The unconventional methods of war work, but they do not destroy the opposition. Gorilla tactics, and the idea of moving amongst civilian populations to engage, and attack, accomplish a very specific set of goals; it does not hold territory, and it does not take territory. Our enemies are observing their inability to advance, and gain ground; now they are adapting a model of engagement that will allow them to strengthen their conventional capabilities. Iran is a great example of country that is maintaining a conventional force, while supporting proxy\\'s to engage US, and Allies. The Taliban, have proven over the last 20 years that they will support, and will directly engage our forces. The Taliban are adopting a strategy that will allow them to control Afghanistan as a recognized State, while still continuing to support militant actions against US.\\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nyhoben macaraig\\n2 months ago\\nGod bless you and your family Mr. President\\nREPLY\\nJDeere\\n2 months ago\\nRetired Special Operators, Volunteers I might add, are a huge reason that thousands are sleeping at peace tonight.

I pray that there is peace in Afghanistan and Taliban can keep their word.  They will need lots of support to fight the ISIS threat and rebuild Afghanistan.  After 20 years of war we should learn that war will not solve this problem but will only ignite and the fire will spread in other parts of the world.  Behind this war we singled and cornered the entire Muslim nation and put a target on a billion people and cornered and declared them as terrorists.

Far better than the vague platitudes of Obama, the bluster and bluff of Trump and the simplistic, asinine rhetoric of George W. Bush.  Everything Biden said here was accurate and based on reality, and he delivered it with sincerity and conviction.  Its time for America to focus on nation building here at home and not pursue a fools errand in the Middle East and Central Asia.  The USA needs to pivot to meet emerging challenges in Asia (China) and also mounting problems in America\\'s own backyard such as securing the border with Mexico and poverty and refugee flows emanating from Latin America. I wholeheartedly think this speech by President Biden was the best I have heard him give in his entire political career!
