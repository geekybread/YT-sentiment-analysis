0,He's doing great things every day guys! He's been creating more Republicans since his first day in office!
1,"The best, most honest part of his speech was when he walked out without answering any questions."
2,"Biden: This mission was a success
Comment section and like dislike ratio: I don't think so."
3,"Biden- “my fellow Americans this war is now over.”
One week later...
Biden- “we are going to war”"
4,"13 Americans dead, and the only one fired was a Marine asking for accountability."
5,There's a difference between ending a war and leaving one.
6,"He’s always so obvious reading his prompter, from his eyes and the tone in his voice"
7,"God bless you Father.
Thank you for making United States of America proud, safe and never ending."
8,"""The chief purpose of government is to protect life.  Abandon that, and you have abandoned all."" ~Thomas Jefferson"
9,"This was a chilling speech. 
If you sat long enough to hear those last 10 minutes and really listened - I think we can all agree it was time to come home. It was always going to be chaotic. ISIS attacked because they knew the airport would be packed and hectic. As soon as either group got wind of our departure things would have escalated quickly, no matter when we began evacuating. The Afghan Gov is corrupt;  telling them our plan ahead of time would be like slipping a note straight to the Taliban. "
10,"Something tells me that this is the end of one thing, and the beginning of something much worse."
11,Best speech yet till 2:13.
12,one of the many 'most important speeches of the year'... so far.
13,They should somehow drop Biden off in Afghanistan and ask him to make it to the airport by himself in 5 days.
14,"I love how other channels disable comments on videos so we don’t disrespect the greatest president ever, Jim Crow Joe"
15,Heartbreaking our soldier from Roseville came home in a casket. So very sad.
16,"Great speech , informative, direct- The ME is a boiling pot - it needs Human Rights, and accountable governance- the US have a huge leverage on many dictators- the US with. Britain and Western nations can lead the way to give hope to hundreds of millions caged in the Middle East- some many ran away in illegal migrants trails , but this does not resolve an unstable region! President Biden certainly can lead the way"
17,"Biden: ""If you don't vote for me, then you ain't Afghan""....agrees no Afghan."
18,Every day this man has contradicted the words he said the other day.
19,"Mr. President, When you enumerate all the challenges facing our nation; with you in charge, it scares the hell out of me!"
20,"Joe Biden on 6/4/20: ""It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others."""
21,Let’s go Brandon 👏👏👏
22,"""I need not tell you the perception around the world in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, is that things are not going well in terms of the fight against the Taliban,"" ""And there is a need, whether it is true or not, there is a need to project a different picture."" -Joe Biden during his July 23rd phone call with X President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani."
23,"Biden paused and returned to his notes, reminding Americans that “we are all in this together.”"
24,Excellent work Mr.President.
25,"This is a really long speech just to say ""He did it. It's not my fault."""
26,We're living in a mad world if you think this is acceptable....😭 I weep for this nation....🇺🇲
27,"""and may god protect our troops, couse we aint gonna..."""
28,We must call for a Convention of States to take back our country! Our constitution has been ignored for too long.. It's time to add new amendments to our constitution to take power back from the oligarchies that are controlling our federal government.
29,What a shame to abandon our citizens in a war zone.
30,"The real winners of the Afghan War: Lockheed Martin: 40 Billion, Raytheon: 38 Billion, Boeing: 32 Billion."
31,"""The extraordinary success of this mission was due to the incredible skill, bravely, and selfless courage...""  That's our president, guys."
32,I think this was a good speech.
33,I agree with everything he said
34,“Most popular president in American history”
35,The “Like” to “Dislike” Ratio did not disappoint!
36,"Biden: ""We ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan."" 
Americans: ""But why?"" 
Our media is so bad."
37,"We all wanted to leave, but we wanted to do it the right way. The way we departed was an utter embarrassment to our American history"
38,I thank you for this
39,He's already proved himself as the best US president of the 21st century. Thank you for ending that freaking war Joe.
40,The saddest part of this Afghanistan 20 years worth of turmoil and evacuation is all our brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives.  Whatever else that was lost doesn't even matter in comparison.
41,He may be able to say its over but in some ways its not😢we lost some beautiful strong courageous people and not every American is able to go home because of how this was done. The ones lost and left behind in the name of emergency evacuation deserve the glory and the ones that saved the others not our government leaders. The real heros and people who should remembered are those i listed.
42,"🇺🇸 Right decision 
Mr. President. 
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
43,"Opinions on the withdraw aside; the enemy we have been facing, is now developing a conventional strategy to engage US. The unconventional methods of war work, but they do not destroy the opposition. Gorilla tactics, and the idea of moving amongst civilian populations to engage, and attack, accomplish a very specific set of goals; it does not hold territory, and it does not take territory. Our enemies are observing their inability to advance, and gain ground; now they are adapting a model of engagement that will allow them to strengthen their conventional capabilities. Iran is a great example of country that is maintaining a conventional force, while supporting proxy's to engage US, and Allies. The Taliban, have proven over the last 20 years that they will support, and will directly engage our forces. The Taliban are adopting a strategy that will allow them to control Afghanistan as a recognized State, while still continuing to support militant actions against US."
44,God bless you and your family Mr. President
45,"Retired Special Operators, Volunteers I might add, are a huge reason that thousands are sleeping at peace tonight. Thank you to the volunteer commandos! You went against this idiotic government's approval and saved lives. We love you for it!"
46,Bless President Biden for ending our longest war ever!
47,"""Hey man, i gave the Apache Helicopters, Guns, and Uniforms so they can make Terrorism great again!"" ~ (Can't finish a term) Biden."
48,"this was an exquisite, Presidential speech. every time I started to think of a question, he would answer it in the next sentence. i really believe it when he says it's the honest truth that we don't have a real reason to be in Afghanistan anymore. the terrorists just want the USA's attention, dollars, and lives. i hope we can establish a way to help innocent refugees in Afghanistan, without playing into another war. we have technology to fight remotely, we have solar, electric, we don't need oil... we are the richest country in the world, and it's time we use our money towards bettering it for real. I try to take it all with a grain of salt, but this was overall excellent public speaking and very authentic"
49,"You told the military to flee in the middle of the night, without telling our allies or warn 100's of thousands civilians and had to go back with triple the number of troops, after telling the Taliban that you declined their offer to control Kabul and the Taliban can manage the entrances into the airport. Then you get 122000 people and only 5400 citizens and call that a success. You give the Taliban a list of names, pictures and biometrics  of everyone and  leave defenseless possibly 1000's of American citizens and afghans that have worked with the Americans."
50,"""It's everyone else's fault but mine.""
-the president with the most votes in history"
51,Love to USA from India 🇮🇳❤️
52,Obama: Don't ever underestimate Biden's ability to f*** things up. His own vice president for 8 years says a lot.
53,I don’t think he’s all there and yet he has access to nukes….. welcome to America 🇺🇸
54,"Thank you President Biden for all you have done, you are doing a fine job and we are behind you 100%! Without you, we would have nothing! May Allah bless you and we will see you real soon when we come for a visit.
Signed, Hibaullah Akhundzada"
55,"'Don't underestimate Joe's ability to (expletive) things up'  - President Obama

All you need to know about Joe's ability to fulfil a promise."
56,God bless Biden
57,"I love the tittle. ""Ending the war in Afghanistan"".  It should have read  ""We pulled out yet, the war rages on!"""
58,"When the impact of this disaster is finally realized, he will likely have started more of a war than he ended."
59,"If his wife or Hunter is still in Afghanistan,  he would not leave them behind."
60,How to fumble the football only to give it back to the opposing team... you made history Joe.
61,"Let's go, Brandon!!!!"
62,"Imagine if you're boss at work when he spoke to the people... he needed a prompter. Would that not be odd to you? But since it's TV,  everyone soaks up the usual."
63,"10:05 LOL Wow Joe, now look at them. They own the whole country, and billions in our infrastructure, munitions, and vehicles. Good job man!"
64,Glory be to God Jehovah and in the name of his son Jesus thank you Lord for ending the war the wall Thank you president trump for starting the process thank you president biding For carrying through the process and ending the war may God protect bless our troops and their family I see was hurt and harm and home and my family so I understand stand the need for them to come home God-bless peace out
65,"In Beijing  they are arguing over which is easier, getting your restaurant order correctly filled or having a POTUS fulfill every possible whim on your wish list."
66,I just love how there’s no positive comments lol. Goes to show how much of a joke everyone as a whole knows  he had no business in office.
67,He reminds me intensely how much I dislike establishment politicians
68,God bless this is history made!!!!! Since I was 11 years old I am now 31 years old! Hallelujah thewar is over!!! Bring the troops over!!!!
69,Good job PRESIDENT 👏  End All Wars!!!
70,Joe “ I ain’t taking no questions” Biden.
71,Poor leadership it breaks my heart
72,Thank you Trump and Biden for leading the way to finally end this war...so sad to see so many Americans wanting more solders to die in the comments from these wars
73,"As a Vietnam Medic in the war, it not fun, it’s real.  People soldiers die, I was there and for what. We need to use our troops correctily.  Sorry for all the Vets that are committing suicide.  I feel your pain in a different way.  Every Veteran’s day, I shed a tear and I see faces of the patients that have died.  No American should see this and that’s the problems.  We have outspoken politicians that were never at war.  Unless you served in the arm forces, you need to listen to those that have.  Again sorry for those that have loss their lives and sorry for those that continue to suffer.   I get it.   I wish those servicemen to seek help and try to deal with the pain."
74,Well done on your effort’s
75,My future husband is a military man and he has been in Syria and God bless him he has seen alot thought the years and he prays for all of his service men and women for this country
76,"there is just no way on earth that I would ever....not ever. Joe, Oh Joe...good luck"
77,RIP to those US  soldiers who died in Afghanistan. 🇺🇸
78,Enjoy the Show!!!
79,Let's go Brandon!!!
80,"well this speech here was a very long and roundabout way of saying ""i actually don't really know what i'm doing"""
81,"""As for the Afghans, we and our partners have airlifted over one hundred thousand of them,"" and only dropped a couple dozen of them."
82,Anything good is my credit and any mistake made is not mine but others... great job.
83,Just when you think it can't get worse Biden says Hold my ice cream.
84,What do they say about “assumptions” Joe? That good ol’e saying is still holding true. 🍻
85,"My poor country, the innocent women of my homeland.😔🇦🇫💔"
86,Greatest president in my life time” - 6 month old immigrant first time voter baby
87,There’s more to it. There always is
88,My grandfather always told me to read between the lines and listen to what they're NOT saying. This colossal jerk is not saying a lot. He's a master of c.y.a.
89,"""Look at what a good job we did cleaning up an unnecessary clusterfuck that we caused"""
90,It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong.
91,Assisting your allies also seems important for the national interest I reckon...
92,Listening to this man makes my head hurt.
93,GOOD SPEECH. You people who think we should have stayed are insane. The weapons the Taliban absconded are from the defeated Afghan army.
94,When the media realized that trump kept their jobs
95,"I'm all for ending the war and leaving. But to leave them all military vehicles, weapons, and forts, is what's insane."
96,How did he honestly win the election?  OMG........shaking my  head........omg.
97,#Make America Great Again🇺🇲
98,"Gee Joe,  ever stop and think those that wanted to stay had listened when you said taliban won't take over.  THAT is why they chose to stay"
99,"Let's go, Brandon!"
100,20:46 yes... yes we do for sure have to learn from our mistakes you are right about that one.. and we learned very quickly what kind of mistake was made.... we are watching it right now...
101,Great speech. I applaud this action
102,"This guy really living in his own fantasy world, but not in our world."
103,Let's go Brandon!
104,"Why do I feel like for the first time in my life that we do not have a president. 
A president is supposed to be a leader and act like a leader, you’re supposed to be the blood of this country while it’s people are the hearts which pump it.
A president is meant to lead and look out for the good of the American people. We just left behind hundreds of Americans in Afghanistan. We believe in leaving no man behind yet, we’ve just left hundreds of our own behind to fend for themselves. I legitimately do not recognize my country for the first time in my life."
105,Thanks to him and his administration our country is now being laughed at by the entire world
106,"Stop criticizing and just learn. Respect the USA despite their mistakes, as they are the first line of defence against authoritarian regimes. Mark my words"
107,"Pretty sure you were VP for EIGHT YEARS AND IN CONGRESS FOR 40+YEARS and did Z E R O, but hey, at least your consistent 👍👍👍 WAY TO GO QUID PRO QUOE JOE, WAY TO GO👍👍👍"
108,A good deadline is always worth putting peoples lives in danger
109,"""No other nation in history had the capacity to perform such a big airlift"". Ok so you're just gonna ignore India's airlift from Kuwait in 1990?"
110,This is what happens when you let corporate media tell you who ought to be the President.
111,#45 Forever! A True Leader! 🇺🇲⚔️   Hey Biden 🖕
112,Good news. Good decision.👏👏🙏🙏 With fight nothing going to gain only to loss number of number American military's.
113,"Couldn't have been a war in the first place, they had enough people to take over that fast we obviously weren't doing any fighting."
114,"I love when a real good President speaks to the people , and I under any circumstance have been brainwashed , I’m not a trump supporter , l ain’t mad"
115,odd how I don't have to read the comments to know how everyone feels...
116,“Let’s go Brandon!!!”
117,Love your freedom people.
118,"Okay, now lets talk about ENDING PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT in the middle of an outbreak for small businesses, gig workers, independent contractors and self employed.....I'm sure the Afghans will get more help than unemployed Americans."
119,The next election day is in 3 years and will be my first time voting. I can tell you one thing I'm not voting for this guy.
120,"""I take full responsibility""
Also: ""well the previous administration.."""
121,So true Mr.President
122,God Help US !!
123,was this a speech that signified that America has won the decades' long war? it seemed to me that Biden delivered the speech with sadness ...
124,Let's go Brandon :)
125,"September 11, 2001 we will never forget...20 years ago...We Will Never Forget!!!!"
126,"Let's go Brandon!

Heyyyy Joe, where you going with our guns in your hands?"
127,When in doubt always blame the last administration
128,"Imagine leaving Americans behind in a country where extremists now fly US military helicopters and drive US military vehicles, losing 13 soldiers in the process, destabilizing the reason and dramatically shifting the national security position of the United States… and then patting yourself on the back."
129,Joe you have put this contry in the worts shape in last 30 years
130,"At the very beginning of this, I thought it was Biden walking out of frame🤣🤣"
131,I seriously hate how he does not take questions from the press.  You gotta answer the people you serve dude.
132,Very good decision no more war
133,The Biden regime! 🇮🇶🇨🇳
134,I was hoping he did the Willy Wonka introduction while walking in!
135,From the Sacramento Bee newspaper- At least 24 students are still stranded in Afghanistan. This should outage the public and disgrace this administration.
136,"My god, everyone.  The war in Afghan was lost years ago.  For years, maybe for even over a decade, the war has been lost.  We just kept funneling money into it and lives and suffering.  It needed to end.  It was never going to end with shining lights and kindness.  "
137,From his speech it seems like he already know and agreement with taliban to take over Afghanistan. He is not worried about Taliban...
138,"WTF Is this some bad joke?

""Make America ashamed again"""
139,YouTube wants to remove the dislike button because Geriatric Joe gets radio’d in every video. 🤣
140,Biden: I take responsibility but Trump and the Afghans are responsible.
141,GOOD RESPONSE 👍!!!
142,"Ah yes. We left military equipment in Afghanistan and watched their government fall to the Taliban.

Sweet victory."
143,"I have a sickening, gut feeling that a terrible inevitable is coming our way. This guy and all his yes men will have not only brought it here but provided the means to do so. I certainly pray I'm wrong."
144,"Its all Trumps fault he says, but yet gives long explanation on how he always wanted to end the war. 🥱"
145,"30 years ago, The Airlift from Kuwait, 1990
~170,000 rescued
Air India operated 488 flights between August and October 20 to airlift an estimated 170,000 Indians stranded in Kuwait after Iraqi’s invasion. At least one country has already done it, Joey. Get your facts right!"
146,"Of course, it’s always someone else fault with this guy."
147,"Our brilliant president is ""looking into the future""! (27:53)."
148,"Handlers: Use your authoritative voice. 
Biden: The yelly one?"
149,Starts at 2:01
150,"I look at my President for Unity, Fairness, and Strong Will, this Veteran leaves this video feeling betrayed, embarrassed, angry and carrying a bag of excuses and hallow words. I pray for those we left behind and that we can get those people out and attempt to reverse this unadulterated betrayal and historical blunder that we have witnessed. Yes you take the responsibility for this yet give a litany of excuses and finger pointing, Mr. President its time for you to own this and do something other than passing the buck."
151,I kno y’all see him reading off something in the background or is it just me😭 cuz I kno he memorize all that and I kno he ain’t saying all this off the top of his head
152,If it’s over then why are people still complaining about it this video needs more views
153,His covid test came back negative 7 times 😡 my message to the people who punished him for this throw your towel in you will not win
154,No nation would leave our allies behind. Lest go Brandon. Desantis 2024
155,It's mind blowing how he can even attempt to try to make a victory speech of any sort. This will be in  the history books forever for heads to shake
156,Very good
157,Just say the truth Biden! We lost the war!
158,"""I respect our troops so much, that is why I was so bored and checked my watch 13 times"""
159,Amen
160,The best teleprompter-reader President ever!!! (But does he know what he reads?).
161,For those that voted for this career politician. I hope next time you vote its not based on your hatred
162,"A reminder this is not a movie clip, he is not Clint Eastwood. 
Although he hammers the point about ending the war, which NO ONE disagrees with, he is brushing over the incompetence we have all witnessed.
You are watching a man reliving fantasies, declining into dementia as we watch."
163,No outsider till now has been and no outsider in future will be able to rule Afghanistan.
164,This reminds me of the Iraqi press conference when the Iraqi press secretary said there were no Americans in Iraq and yet you could see the city being bombed.  This is so bad.  Did ANYONE actually vote for this guy?
165,"That is, by far, the strangest address I’ve ever seen a President give."
166,Your Frist words should be condolences to the families of marines that lost there life💕 going back to Clean up your mess 🖕🏴‍☠️
167,"Why can't he just say, ""We messed up!"""
168,"To save this country and those lost faith in America, please resign, Joe Biden!"
169,"We definitely had no choice but doing this in the way this administration did it. Actually, it was supposed to be more chaotic but this administration and this President did it smoothly. May God Bless the United States of America, the memories of those who died in this crazy war, and our President Biden !"
170,"The ""mission accomplish speech."" only Bush just sort of stopped talking about it.  He didn't pull the troops, minus all the military hardware....or leave our allies to die...or hand out a named list of everyone that was stupid enough to help us to the taliban, a peace protest against our help."
171,Never underestimate Joe’s ability to f**k things up ~ Barack Obama
172,"It's gonna be a long 3.5 years, ladies and gentlemen."
173,He is scolding the stranded !  How many of the 19 warnings before his statement of nothing similar to Saigon would happen.
174,It’s high time we brought our troops home. We already won the war against Al-Qaeda years ago.
175,I feel like we should've gotten rid of the supplies that was left by exploding the facilities and taking what we could back to America besides leaving it all there and having the Taliban have more  equipment.
176,"10k thumbs down, 4.2k thumbs up... and you expect me to belive he won the election fair and square?"
177,Bravely? Guy makes up his own words and his own success
178,I take responsibility for those decisions but it's mostly trump's fault
179,"Thank God Our Troops r getting out of a place they really should have never been. There's no way to change what's going on in that place , I wish it was but there's not. I wish so many had not died in that wretched place."
180,It’s time for Joe to accept responsibility for the train wreck in Afghanistan - you have blood on your hands - RESIGN!!!!
181,"Your hand gestures and attempted ""tough guy"" voice make you look even more putz-like. It's past your nap time."
182,Let’s go Brandon!!
183,"Beginning, I thought he was asleep and forgot that he had speech to give."
184,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
185,Ever heard of the pineapple express? They'll get every US citizen that's still alive. There are high school kids that were left. This guy should be court marshalled.
186,"His consciousness already left long time ago, what you’re seeing is a just a physical hologram"
187,The war was over. We were there for support
188,"I didn’t vote for Biden last time but 
I’ll be voting for Biden this time
Biden2024"
189,"As a Libertarian I agree with the move,

I just can’t feel that the execution was poor; it would have never been a good withdrawal "
190,"C’mon man, you know the things!"
191,I’m with you Joe. You saved a lot of lives. Brought in positive change to our countries identity.
192,I'm Joe Biden and I approved this MESSage!
193,"Old sleepy uncle Joe 

Bless him, no really a true leader is he 😔"
194,Yup this is real USA voted for this guy.
195,"China never announce their military plans, so why did the US do that and expose themselves?  Because of that, resources and innocent lives were lost.  Salute to the service folks, always."
196,Jimmy carter is now on second position.....Joe on top now
197,"Ex Gen Dan McNeill stated when asked if Afghan war was worth it?  Going onto say he hoped one day to have an answer.   Mine is if after all the errors it finally produced a President/leader of quality it would have been worth it.   I planned the Bin Laden Raid in the knowledge the result had to be conclusive and gain outright support..... Time we generate a forward moving country..... One which is listened too and trusted by the world, we owe our kids peace ..... Right now we are not trusted by almost anyone"
198,Unfortunately those that want to get out probably have no capability of communicating that plea.  They are hostages soon to be on display for public execution.   Thanks Joe
199,How do you know when the POTUS is lying?
200,"Joe, Bring them home!!"
201,He makes me feel happy for Jimmy Carter.  He finally gets to see the day when where his legacy is no longer the worst president in US history
202,"What an embarrassment...America the world is shocked at what you've done!! As for sky news Australia they really can not stand Biden and Harris, i was watching it earlier!! The first 2 minutes were his most successful bit of this video.."
203,10% left behind. For the Big Guy!
204,Checking my watch the whole time because I have to leave and talking about my son who didn't see a day in combat and died at home he sent those kids to their death
205,"You can replace Biden's speech with a sound bite from Counter strike saying ""Terrorists win!"" and it would be shorter and more accurate."
206,"Too many narrow minds out there. ""It doesn't matter how you get there because the end result is the only thing that matters"""
207,"CNBC always forces the word ""President"" in their vid title because they know that the world doesn't recognise this senile old man as ""President"". We miss Trump terribly!"
208,Anyone want to see the conversation joe Biden had with the former president of Afghanistan???
209,Biden...making Obummer look better every day
210,This man could wrap his won present and still be surprised on Christmas! He voted for this war and voted against withdrawal over the last 19 yrs until last year.
211,"""I did such a great job, folks, I'm awarding myself The Medal of Honor, Valor and Purple Heart...I'm a hero!"" - Joe Biden"
212,"So the ones that stay they can be attacked, I'm just trying to understand what he's reading"
213,When somebody ask the president to take out the troop and end the war doesn't mean leave the important things behind.
214,How can we (your allies) trust you after this? Zero communication zero organisation. We had our own troops there but we didn't leave our choppers and weapons there. And now we had to send our own rescue mission to get out our guys who were stranded. It is embarrasing for USA
215,"the ""war"" ended but not only did we not win we lost even more just trying to leave. This by no means is a success this is an absolute failure in the goal of just trying to save people and our own."
216,It’s like saying I’ve completed school by dropping out in the 5th grade. It may be true but it doesn’t make it smart.
217,"Here we see a wrinkled and stiff 6 year old read an excuse note, written by his mom, to try and justify getting out of PE. It’s sad to see him failing so grotesquely at the job he is meant to do and blow boat loads of smoke up his ass to make the wound to heal quicker. I don’t know what he thinks of us, but I damn well know when I hear BS and it is flowing from him like a river!"
218,I just feel that it could have been done better
219,"""The decisions I MAKE, are NOT my fault"". 🖕😂👌"
220,I love how he’s trying to talk with authority… As he squints his eyes at the Teleprompter
221,I’m glad we’re out of Afghanistan but I wish it were more planned out on the exit.
222,90 out of 80 people wanted to stay........Joe Biden
223,Biden: we did again. Proud to be American.
224,Let's go Brandon
225,"""Some say 'couldn't this have been done in a more orderly manner?' I respectfully disagree!"" - Yikes!!!"
226,Thank you for having the Balls to get out of bad relationship that was ruining us. Thank you sir!
227,"This is like getting an A for effort, but failed two times on execution. You messed up, Joe! But good job…."
228,"Minute 12:30 We airlifted out (only) 5,500 Americans (but we were able to get out) 100,000 Afghans."
229,Thank you Biden for speaking like a president not name calling thanks Robert May hazard.ky u doing 👌
230,Nothing like giving your enemy the whole game plan and still expecting to succeed.
231,Now think of it.  We have the Gettysburg address and now this.  Every other speech will alternately be something in between
232,I think USA now has enough experience in withdrawal plans
233,This man has no shame.
234,"USA Failed for second time in Asia, this is the question American sympathizers assert and Taliban won the freedom war."
235,The best part was at the end when he didn't take any questions.
236,it doesn't sound like you ended a war when you left billions of dollars of equipment for them to use against us.
237,This is what you get when the USA has elections in the twilight zone
238,Im just glad the election is over and now we can all go back to blaming the president for all our problems
239,“Death to tyrants “
240,You made a decision and didn’t tell anyone including our allies. It was a colossal failure to execute the withdrawal so it’s a sham to call it successful
241,“Extraordinary success”
242,When will it be enough my fellow Americans? When will we stand up and say no more
243,Is this the “make it better than it is” speech the other guy was suppose to give? Asking for a fellow citizen.
244,"Biden: President Obama and me ended the war, no more questions. 

Handlers: 😳 we quit he goes of script to many times. "
245,Massive respect for making the world an even more dangerous place in only 2 weeks.
246,"This man doesn't know how talk for himself, this is insane that we have an actual puppet as a president lol"
247,More or less the same speech he had a week ago.
248,"$9.4 billion that belongs to Afghanistan was frozen by the U.S. and the IMF.
Many of the government workers were not paid for many months.
Afghanistan is a poor country. It needs the funds to buy food, medicine and meet other basic needs."
249,Now the question remains when are we going to get out of Iraq for good?
250,Nothing but negative comments haha I love it! Cause we know…Trump won
251,I don't support any side we just need someone younger trust worthy respectful and more but sadly there aren't many like that
252,Giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.
253,"you made the decision to end this war, but blame trump for the withdrawal? 🤨"
254,"Quitting is the new winning culture nowadays....I saw it used in the Tokyo Olympics by the US athletes,  but I never thought I would see it used in Afghanistan."
255,Joe Biden : I've been instructed to act tough for this speech
256,"I think you meant ""Biden reads a teleprompter"""
257,"Thank you, Joe Biden! You are the only person I ever voted for who actually did what he said he would do! Bravo!!"
258,"Almost every sentence contradicted by previous statements and video footage. Doesn't he have staff that proofs his speeches? Insult our intelligence then; blame, blame, blame!"
259,"I've come to realize now, that 'anyone' can be President of the United States."
260,He really thinks he handed this well.
261,In A War No One Wins
262,"so… if ending wars is a thing, when is the assistance in South Korea going to end?"
263,We need Trump back
264,"He's trying to sound so tough. It's laughable.  What a damn joke. He didn't end the war, he surrendered."
265,This was a success. So giving our enemy billions worth of equipment is a success?
266,"You lost the war, ran like cowards in the end."
267,The greatest comedy of all time. Lookin forward to the guy who comes out with the bat at the end. 🥲🤣😂🇦🇺Swear it’s a Punch n Joe B pantomime. Love America but you guys are screwed with this clown n kamilla de harass in charge😎🇦🇺👊🏻🤍❤️☘️Sack them as quick as ya can. Love Australia and Ireland 😂☘️
268,Thank you for being an honest man.
269,Gotta give it to Biden he didn’t stumble in his words and also didn’t give media answers because we all know what media can alter someone’s sayings
270,This guy can't even get more upvotes than downvotes on a network leftist news station.  How the heck did he win the country?
271,Seeing the taliban flying blackhawks and flying thier flag from it and mocking the running scared Americans 😂😂😂
272,I thought the original conflict was cause by Sadam Hosaine in Iraq? That’s why our troops hunted Sadam down like a dog in a hole and put him on trial with the UN? Does anyone but me remember this part of the last 20 years?
273,Finger point to you!.
274,"""We gotta learn from our mistakes"" in other words, ""let's blame Trump for all of my failures."""
275,"<Slow clap> Joe takes his victory lap. Oh wait, he's just lost and looking for the door they told him to walk through."
276,i hope yall biden voters are happy 👍🏻
277,This is what you guys voted for
278,Wow. What a proud lying spirit he has.
279,"If you voted for this, congratulations, you played yourself."
280,HE DID NOT END IT HE HAS STARTED IT AGAIN!
281,But you left the person who saved you and Sen. Kerry...We know you don't remember
282,"Chinese people really like civil war, in addition to having a lot of people, there is no advantage, please support Taiwanese."
283,Blood on the hands !
284,Biden: I came thru and I shall not return.
285,"If he knew it was going to be chaotic and complex, why did he go on vacation?"
286,"When comments start with ""it only happens in Nigeria""...it sounds like a sound bite"
287,"No one disagrees with the decision to pull out of Afghanistan. It is how it was done, Mr. President, that we are disgusted over. This is not a victory but a precursor to something much worse."
288,He drips insincerity.
289,"In 2021 ""retreats"" are now called ""withdraws"""
290,Going against everything  our country has ever stood for.
291,Let me pat myself on the back for such a successful mission while simultaneously blaming everyone else for all the failures.
292,"Your “tally’s” are some what correct, however, YOU FAILED TO MENTION THE 85 BILLION IN TAX PAYER DOLLARS you handed the enemy in equipment and cash…"
293,The “Biden 13 .”
294,"He made the tough choice and hopefully right choice to get us out of Afghanistan.  That country is known as the ""graveyard of nations"", this statement should give you goosebumps.  Taliban were able to take over Afghanistan without a single shot that says alot about US intelligence and who Afghan people really support.  I pray that there is peace in Afghanistan and Taliban can keep their word.  They will need lots of support to fight the ISIS threat and rebuild Afghanistan.  After 20 years of war we should learn that war will not solve this problem but will only ignite and the fire will spread in other parts of the world.  Behind this war we singled and cornered the entire Muslim nation and put a target on a billion people and cornered and declared them as terrorists.  Hundreds and Thousands of innocent American and Muslims suffered because of this war."
295,"'' an extraordinary success ''

I'd hate to see what he calls a complete disaster."
296,Do you think we can afford to get Joe some wooden blocks or a coloring book for his speeches... not buying rifling through pages or this note card deal.
297,"You know we got a lot of ununderstandablemumbling in Afghanistan and I wanna thank the Taliban for securing the airport and err, here is the deal, you know, the thing"
298,"9:25 well joe, you didn’t do great at that"
299,"Does anyone believe for a second that 5,000 people declined his offer to help them leave??"
300,"Why did he ""warn"" them 19 times if he thought the Afghan government was ""trained"" and ""equipped""."
301,When you brag about failing.
302,Sleepy Joe ratio'd yet again😂🤣😂
303,I want Trump back!
304,"THE WAR IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE WAR!"
305,"You told the military to flee in the middle of the night, without telling our allies or warn 100's of thousands civilians and had to go back with triple the number of troops, after telling the Taliban that you declined their offer to control Kabul and the Taliban can manage the entrances into the airport. Then you get 122000 people and only 5400 citizens and call that a success. You give the Taliban a list of names, pictures and biometrics  of everyone and  leave defenseless possibly 1000's of American citizens and afghans that have worked with the Americans."
306,"Taliban: violates fundamental human rights
Joe Biden: *Sends angry letter"
307,"Obama  inspires, Trump antagonizes, Biden Hypnotizes."
308,"""no nation has ever done anything like it in history""
 what about Dunkirk"
309,What does he mean “not for professional gain”? That’s such an odd random thing to say OR is it where his administrations head is at? Was it a Freudian slip by the speech writers? 3:42
310,When he talks he makes me feel like my dyslexia transfers to my ability to listen instead of reading.
311,Why are you yelling at us Mr President?
312,"This is what you have to do when you can't say, ""Meh, they're just a bunch of Afghans anyway."""
313,"This hollow shell of a man “IS MY HERO!” 

Is it bravery? or bravely Joe? You opened up with a word salad! Bin Laden? You were against the mission to get Bin Laden!"
314,"I must admit, I'm a little confused as to why there is so much hatred here. That briefing seemed like a measured, justified explanation for what he did. If you recall Trump made a deal with the Taliban behind the back of the Afghan government. He inherited a disaster and made the best of what he was given. Should he have condemned thousands more citizens to the trauma of that conflict? What would be the objective? "
315,"I’m the type of boss that won’t obsess with the “how”, as long as I get good results.  And boy am I not liking these results"
316,Everyone else caused the problem but he has not fired any of those folks who advised him before he made a very bad decision about the evacuations. Pittiful.
317,Do you want to hear hear a good joke!  Ready?  Biden is a genius!
318,If you wasn't too busy signing executive orders you could have had this done properly on May 1st
319,Not Biden walking off dramatically at the end 4 me
320,"Remember, Remember this time when the POTUS turned his back on America."
321,Be forgot to add the part where his homies in CHYYYYINA have a foot hold and companies digging out minerals and materials to make lithium in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is the Saudi Arabia of lithium. Remember their green new deal agenda. Follow the money. Pockets are deep
322,Peace time...
323,Biden gets on my nerves not answering questions. we need to get another president I think he needs to be impeached he not done anything to help the United States 😡😡😡 at least Trump  stood up for the people
324,"This guy literally didn't have a plan. 

He gave up Bagram Air Base, withdrew all close air support and military contractors from the country (doesn't surprise me that the Afghan military just crumbled as a result), and essentially gave Kabul to the Taliban despite the fact that they didn't have to. There are many other actions that were just stupidly done on top of those already mentioned. On July 8th he stated that you wouldn't see helicopters taking off from the roofs or grounds of the US Embassy. He messed this up in every way possible and yet the media is going out and trying to cover for him. He also blames everyone but himself for this debacle. What a terrible president. "
325,"Why do I never feel proud, uplifted, hopeful, and encouraged after hearing this president? More importantly, why do I even listen to him anymore?"
326,They never wanted our help dont want it good job
327,Honestly fearing and can’t wait for the day that Gen z takes over this world
328,After well over a trillion dollars has been spent on state building in Afghanistan now it's a bad idea?! Really?? Just when we thought that spending millions to build sophisticated electronic case-filing systems for courts in a country that has no electricity was a great idea!
329,"Afghanistan is the right place to bury the Empires
You will never forget that learn your lesson
#Afghanpower
#ZANDABADAFGHANISTAN"
330,They did their jobs and did it well too bad we can’t say the same thing for you
331,It’s literally 1980s politics
332,so he waited 3 months and got everything he was warned about
333,"For the Chinese,Biden acted like a reality show🤪"
334,Those 13 heroes deaths are on his head!
335,Never underestimate Joe's ability to 🖕 thing's up.
336,"I take FULL RESPONSIBILITY!.. but let me point out (by pointing and jabbing my E.T. like finger) that most of the blame for how it went lays with the Afgan leaders, the Afgan military, my own military and civilian advisors, those left behind, and Trump... the buck stops with me!"
337,Ending the war or losing the war
338,"Over 2,325 years ago--Alexander the Great himself knew (While conquering and subduing all Greece ---Europe and Asia, through Afghanistan, Iraq and ending up in India ), that out of all his travels ---Only Afghanistan was the one territory he feared.   In his journals written by his biographer he wrote about the Nomad tribes in Afghanistan ---""""Men, he said speaking to his generals---lets get out this forsaken and hellish place. There is nothing here in the best interests of Greece. Although I have great respect for their solitude ----these are a people who often employ gorilla warfare and will stab you back or slit your throat while you are sleeping. This wasteland isn't worth it...    That said, may God bless President Joe Biden for finally abiding by the Prophecy of Alexander the Great ---and getting the hell out of there, and bringing our soldiers home for good and ending a long drawn out war that will go on and on and go no-where.. God bless America.!"
339,Don’t blame me I’m a trump supporter
340,Oops. They left the comments on. This should be a good few hours of entertainment.
341,"I like when he pulls down his mask and coughs in his hand.  For me, that's a defining moment."
342,Calling Biden a real President is like calling Jeffery Damher a gourmet chef 🤡
343,"How is that our president if those are not his words??? He even had to read the ""Thank You God Bless"" part."
344,These words are methodical… he is trying to write  history and he is trying to control what will be said about him… he knows those that stand with him will sound byte this as if he was glorious… I mean he was a glorious bungholio
345,Wow! He’s blaming a lot of people. But did a perfect job himself.
346,Was it me or was he straining so hard just to read.
347,Holy crap he looks tired! Grettings from a Trump supporter of Denmark
348,They dont even legitimately brief him with factual data.
349,I CANNOT STAND THIS MAN !!! LORD FOR GIVE ME!
350,I keep expecting him to walk onto the screen and get to the podium before he realizes he isnt wearing his pants.
351,I'm glad your leaving those 23 students from America there. They were training in terrorist camps anyways...
352,He's just pulling all the troops in preparation for the war on our home turf
353,"“Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community...” -Joe Biden"
354,He is living in pure fantasy land. To call this anything other than a defeat and betrayal of all the people who died and have been left behind is just ludicrous.
355,Wait so he just ended a war but is still fighting the war that ended?
356,I can’t believe this guy is still in office. Unbelievable!! 🤦🏻‍♂️
357,Most votes ever yet always more down thumbs than up. Welcome to The Twilight Zone.
358,But no nation ever left their people behind except you Mr. Biden.
359,I am the only one that sometimes Biden look like Firemen bill from the  90s tv show in living color
360,Maury Povich: we ran your numbers and determined that was lie
361,.#imwithBiden #greatdesition #nomorewar
362,"""However, the most cruel mistake occurred with the failure to understand the Vietnam War. 

Some people sincerely wanted all wars to stop just as soon as possible; others believed that there should be room for national, or communist, self-determination in Vietnam, or in Cambodia, as we see today with particular clarity. "
363,Can I just get a copy of the speech instead of having to listen to this guy read it poorly from the teleprompter?
364,"I'm glad we're getting out of there, but I think we're gonna get another attack from them."
365,What a time to be alive LMFAO The whole world falling apart 😂😂
366,thought it was power to the people well if he’s messing up so bad when will he be impeached
367,Let them in your home Joe
368,Beautiful speech! Greetings from Europe.
369,"It may be sad and inhumane towards the afghan people. But he truly put America first, by pulling out and refusing to spend another American life or dollar going forward. America is not the world's police force, no other country does what America does on that scale.
It's a valid albeit cold and hard perspective as an American president. Just wish we could have somehow better prepared and transfered to the afghans while leaving."
370,"Why did you leave Bagram AFB and decide to do the evacuations from the densest part of Kabul, which created mass confusion and the hardest logistical maneuverability possible?"
371,He seems quite clear to me. Someone finally had the guts to pull the plug on this hopeless enterprise. I sure didn't expect it to be pretty. He reafffirmed my decision to vote for him.
372,Hooray!
373,You can literally see his pupils reading left to right
374,Gaslighting for an entire speech. Impressive.
375,I take full responsibility then he continues to name everyone involved if I’m going down you are all coming with me-This man is dangerous.
376,"Poor old man will be remembered for killing his own men and supplying our enemies with weapons, then claiming victory while his enemies also sing of victory!!!! Sick man!!!!"
377,Now i understand why they removed the dislike button.
378,When Trump would speak I couldn’t even get myself to listen because I always muted him
379,"Funny thing is go back when he was running for the White House how people literally would cut throats for sleepy joe. Now all you hear is ""maybe he shouldn't be in office"" lmao no no stand by your choice dont hide now."
380,"""The quickest way to end a war is lose."" - Megadeth"
381,Trump: miss me yet? 😂🤣
382,"God bless the one President -Biden who finally got the guts to end this horrible war and bring our Soldiers home . Hell, I do believe we should hold a homecoming parade for the hero's who served in this war, among others ---marching down the canyon of Hero's on Broadway in N.Y.C, With President Biden and Jill heading the possession of course. As Jean Luc Picard would say----MAKE IT SO.!"
383,There's pictures of the Taliban flying helicopters we left behind... with people hanging from ropes underneath. 10/10 administration. Definitely better than orange man.
384,Where’s the apology for completely letting American citizens and allies down?
385,Damn that man can lie.
386,How the hell was this a success?
387,"What do you mean ""if they want out"" 
Is there a holiday in resort somewhere in Afghanistan???"
388,"Preventing an attack yet bragging about how 100,000 of them have moved to the u.s"
389,"Do you see it in the strain of their families, or were you looking at your watch?"
390,"Giving up Afghanistan to terrorist and not having secure border seems to me like mayor problem, sadly it won’t be long before more Americans join the 13 fallen Soldiers"
391,Shameless!
392,"finally, the war is over."
393,"Don't understand the hate on this decision.. Yes soliders were lost but more could have died if they remain. How don't you overfed babies  not understand this, Taliban has taken over half of Afghanistan since last year waiting for May deadline, it's a miracle they agreed August 31..."
394,Impeach Biden
395,“…….not for personal gain but for the service of others”.   I wonder how many times he had to practice that one to keep the straight face.
396,And in turn direct your attention to attack the people of your country. Good job tyrant!
397,We succeeded in doing what we wanted to do in Afghanistan?........ building up isis and  gifting them billions in equipment? We nailed that goal 🥅
398,"""Com on man"" I had to leave the equipment there china told me to how else would our new partners the taliban distract the indian military for china"
399,"I don't think I can even have him run my grocery store, why the dems chose him as president?"
400,I cant imagine being a family member of one of the 13 slain soldiers or one of the many civilians still left behind and having to listen to this rubbish???
401,"""I was just at Dover AFB checking my watch""."
402,Was that skill  and BRAVELY?  anybody in the military  is more then likely in grave danger  under your command.
403,"This must be the ""tell a lie enough times it becomes true"" plan."
404,"""The Tali-Bahn""

Are we Afghans? Do we pronounce it the way they pronounce or do we pronounce the way Americans pronounce it?"
405,"If you listen to him at 1.5x speed, he actually sounds like a normal human. Same bull, but at least it sounds normal."
406,No one ever done it because no one ever left their allies behind.
407,"Good ole dementia Joe, the best president the taliban ever had"
408,Likes vs dislikes tells whole story
409,Joe is all about having a good time
410,"Thank for all of the cool stuff you left behind  -Sincerely,  The Taliban"
411,...and Joe plays his fiddle as the nation Burns Down
412,I checked my watch every minute during this speech! He’s a disaster!!!
413,Wow I thought we had it bad in Canada with r guy but Trudeau makes Biden look like a fool and that’s scary
414,Now allies are doubting to USA 🤣🤣🤣
415,Future is more secure when our enemy has been equipped with billions of dollars of military equipment and ammunition?
416,10k thumbs down I wonder why?
417,This dude wouldn’t know what a wise decision was if it bit him in the ass.
418,does this guy have ANY support?
419,He ALWAYS sounds like he’s about to nod off. 🤦‍♀️
420,What about the service dogs left behind? Where’s the transparency? Biden’s lacking the courage Americans are looking for.
421,"Thank you President Biden, my 2 , sons that are 25 and 21 thank you, my 17 yr old son who doesn’t have to make a choice now to serve can live a life without the back thought of serving thanks you! The only people unhappy are the defense contractors plus corrupt politicians making money, millions of above and below the table are unhappy!!! Thank you and God Bless America🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍"
422,The only thing they did successfully was evacuating in this war
423,No more war
424,TRUMP 2024 💯
425,"Ben Dover wants to have a word with you, Biden. You also know him as Mr. Taliban."
426,I know many who are leaving the military.
427,"We pulled out and now its time to go back,  all those allies there getting murdered...they hate us more then ever"
428,"""Nobody left behind"" Except 10 %"
429,There’s actually people giving this video a thumbs up. Please help me understand.
430,This is scary... thanks alot democrats!

434,This man has done more for the Arabs in 7 months than he's done for black ppl in whole entire political career !
435,Why not mention the names of each of those brave KIA servicemen whose lives were lost? Seems like this would have been an opputune time to commemorate their sacrifice
436,Based on YouTube alone his approval rating is....
437,The world wants to know what the hell Biden why ..why ......that real question for everything why
438,Ending? This is just the beginning.
439,Nice he successfully made Taliban modern force with those weapons
440,Sometimes I'm embarrassed to serve the military......
441,I'm not a Gold Star Parent. But I play one on television.
442,Unanimous and ignominious advisors

444,"On Facebook, people are saying Biden had a press conference where he was answering questions from reporters yesterday (8/31) does anyone know where to find that (if it even happened)?"
445,I'm still waiting for the Biden Rallies. A President so popular as 80 Million Vote Biden should easily fill up stadiums.
446,Thank you President Joe Biden for ending the longest war.. I appreciate it ❤️💖
447,The whole Bin Laden thing was a few years after Sadam.
448,You left our people and our dogs of war!
449,"No hello? Good day to you too, sir!"
450,Imagine trying to tell Americans they can’t own an AR 15 when they just gift wrapped the taliban enough weapons to wage an offensive war against an conventional army.
451,Twenty years and a trillion dollar and thousands of lives to drive Talliban out of power then the end was to fly the head of Taliban back to Afghanistan on an American plane . This is just bad politics as usual.
452,"Yes we need term limits, but it needs to be based on report cards. Congress to the President needs to be graded quarterly on several criteria, and those results decide if they keep their job or not. Pelosi and waters would have been gone ages ago. This guy wouldn't be here, because his VP report card would have barred him from politics"
453,May the stain of our Service men and women's blood never leave your hands
454,He uses % numbers about as well as an 8th grader.
455,All the arguments about why you should not be in Afghanistan are not an excuse for getting out in the worst possible way.
456,2/1 dislike ratio.  Who in the hell are they polling out there on Joe's Approval Rating?
457,I'm running for President in 2024
458,Impeach him

461,"Imagine if you ordered a pizza and instead of pepperoni they put dog food on it instead, and on the way to your house the pizza guy dropped it in the dirt face down, picked it up and stuffed it back in the box in pieces, let it get rained on and then showed up at the door with a soggy, dirt covered pizza and with a big smile on his face announces ""here's your pizza, right on time!"" But if you want to complain remember that it's your fault because after all it was you who ordered the pizza in the first place."
462,Wow now he's blaming Afghan president.......he just gave the names of all involved in the decision to retreat.
463,There wouldn't have to be an airlift if you wouldn't have abandoned US citizens.   What a clown 🤡
464,You didn't pick up the man and his family that saved your life while you were there. He's still begging for help. How ashamed are you??!!??!
465,That's funny I thought he has been saying trump did it...now he's saying he did
466,He just reads what is put in front of him. All caps obviously because he was sternly lecturing the world about how he did a super job. 🤡
467,And the Service Dogs that have been left behind.  No words!!!
468,"OMG, he's still bragging!"
469,We were set for a conditional withdrawal. Instead we got a unconditional surrender. Our own people & our allies have been betrayed. Our occupation needed to end but it didn't have to end like this.
470,"I love how he says we will keep supporting Afghanistan….., giving them billions of dollars in best American weapons is not enough? Did anyone ask American people?  Would of been great stand up comedian"

478,Joe. Do we have any friends except China?
479,"What a pathetic person, this is what you get when have politicians who have lived off of the taxpayers pretty much their entire adult life."
480,His story keeps changing.....
481,"As someone who don't live in USA the whole afghanistan thing looks ridiculous. The afghan people had 20 freaking years to arm themselves and defend their livelihood and families, but they choose to stay inactive, waiting someone else to keep them safe. Instead of running like rats from a sinking ship  they should stay and figth. They may die someone could say, well freedom is not an easy thing to obtain it needs sacrifices. Don't expect people from other countries to make those sacrifices for you."
482,Impeach him!
483,"“The Americans we evacuate won’t vote Democrat, so we need to evacuate those who will thank us by giving us their vote” is that what you meant?"
484,The commanders in the field told you six months ago what it would take. You did not listen or heed their advice. Your speech is a total lie!!
485,We have more troops in SPAIN than we had in Afghanistan.
486,"My vision getting worse watching my man squint so hard, get him a closer screeen.... CMAN MAN!"

494,Where are the liberals to back up this guy only hear crickets 🦗
495,He says how good the intelligence was and then says they had no idea that the local army would fold so fast. He made this problem and then blames everyone else. I can't watch this anymore. It just makes me sick to my stomach.
496,He reminds me of Obama. He truly believes that he's intelligent.
497,13k thumbs down 4.8k thumbs up. WOW
498,Wow starting off with victim blaming.

500,"As a Veteran, i am angry, depressed, feel helpless. We had this drilled into our heads, NO PERSON LEFT BEHIND!! Biden dropped the Bowling Ball"
501,Plus he says he ended the war excuse me slow joe you surrendered 20yrs for what and now you act tough your worse than these internet keyboard gangsters.
502,Passing the buck isn't a sign of good leadership
503,This is a recording... Why do I have to wait 2 minutes in silence for the President to psych himself up in the back?
504,Love the Taliban and Isis fighters coming on over
505,Why does he contradict himself in the same speech? Are we sure he's okay?
506,Is this real life right now?
507,"Let's recall who STARTED this failed war, shall we?"
508,"@4:00~ The President states April 2021 was when HE determined to pull out of Afghanistan in April 2021, even though in other RE PORTS he's known to have blamed the previous President for his foreign policy decisions that led to HIS being forced to leave with a deadline of August 31st. So now we have from the President himself his admission that the dramatic and historic motions UN like anything since the Korean War, still without truce, are his UN less he forgot to give credit to the State Dept. or CIA. The ball has been in RE VERSE motion for another Q WART TARE & EYE haven't seen the ball carried forward since WWII."
509,Sounds like he’s reading a laggy teleprompter
510,can't watch him for more than a couple minutes.
511,I thought he did a good job 👀 👍#blkprgrsv21
512,We don’t forgive???  I thought it was we forgive but never forget I guess I’m wrong on that
513,Once a fraud always a fraud.
514,This guy is completely oblivious or an agent to coup.
515,This is when families are having funerals
516,Sounds like hes praising the exit/evacuation.   so does that mean trump gets all the credit?   last week he said this was trumps plan.
517,Impeach Biden
518,"The Hell with Truth, Honor, Accountability, now look, it's a done deal, it's lunch time, then a nap."
519,"Great stuff from yourself and that other eejit Johnson now you both have to sit around the table with the Taliban,and they....pardon the pun....Will be calling the shots this will go down as one of the biggest balls ups in history,hundreds of years from now if mankind is still here history students will be going ""They did what."""
520,I’m so confused on how this is our president. What is life?
521,"Seriously, the problem with 9/11 was not Afghanistan but the controls at the US airports. And secondly, who wants to defend the west if some people fly into universe with private means and some live on the streets."
522,9th year of being at the highest level of the executive branch. you can tell it has worn his ass down. But he needed 4 to 8 more years of greed and power.
523,"US was spending $360/millions per day for each day in Afghanistan (over 20 years) it was the right decision to end the war, just not like this."
524,Don’t assume anything when you are the President of the United States.
525,I'm patting my self on the back for a job well done. Anyhting that went wrong is someone else fault.
526,NOW WHAT ARE THOSE AMERICAN GOING TO DO BACK IN AMERICA? BE HOMELESS ? OR HATED BY THEIR COMUNITIES ? BECAUSE MOST  AMERICAN DONT HAVE ANY COMPASSION OR TOLERANCE FOR DIFFERENT  AND NEW PEOPLE IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.
527,He needs to be resign or be impeached
528,"So in simple terms, we now negotiate with terrorists :)"
529,Every time people wrong him they end up looking stupid at the end throw your towel in  this administration needs to tell the people who punished him for the terrisoms act from 1976  throw your towel in ! Or risk embarrassing yourself for wrongful punishing him 😡
530,Should have left 19 years ago. This withdrawal was horrendous. This is an excellent example of denial.
531,he gets more and more into trouble with each day that passes
532,"The only thing on Biden’s mind is, how much Hunters Paintings will sell for!"
533,God knows Hunter wouldn't leave all that military equipment in Afghanistan cause he could cluck it off to the local crack dealers
534,Trump where are you ? we need you now.
535,Here's to you president Biden and your cabinet. Get the ****(OUT)!! Cowboy up America🤠☝🦅
536,Withdraws are complex for USA because we are not used to RUNNING AWAY

551,@19:30 he for sure didnt realize what he was saying. Smh.
552,Wow I haven't found a single supporter in the comments. Where did they all go? Does everyone feel stupid now? 🤔
553,You need to jump too many mental hurdles to justify this disaster.
554,14:21 I'm not sure what to do with my hands.
555,When the ratio is this bad on CNBC it's impossible to hide that this is an administration that's in crisis.
556,"This guy needs to be removed from White House. Everyone is suffering cause of him. We the people of Louisiana cannot get supplies because of this president. We need food, ice, and most importantly gas. We have to travel or wait hours for fuel and when you do find fuel it’s expensive. Joe Biden must go. We cannot handle four years of this administration"
557,Not him stuttering in the middle of his threat...
558,Lifted then all+ an airmiftairlift for remaining Americans
559,This guy is so far gone
560,leaving $85 billion worth of military equipment to the taliban seems a lot like the definition of treason
561,"“Im pulling us out. I’m taking all the credit” 

Fails...."
562,I voted for him. I’m glad and I’m proud.
563,"I wish Joe and other politicians had to actually face and answer to all Americans and not some fake news uh, I can't even remember what the word is for news people..."
564,#PINO the installed Resident
565,"This is like a doctor saying ""the surgery was a success, i removed the tumor. The patient is dead by the way""."
566,"""Success?"" 13 Military members died! This wasn't success. If he didn't sneak the military out in the middle of the night, this wouldn't have happened. Not questioning the withdraw but the sequence was idiotic!"
567,He do better just to give his resignation speech
568,"Loser didn’t say anything about billions of dollars of ammonia, firearms, ordinance, equipment and heavy machinery…."
569,His fault
570,He is  So PAINFUL to listen to.
571,Long live Donald Trump
572,Maybe pols should learn to apologize and show some humility
573,What about all the Weapons and armoury you gave up and left behind.? If the Tailban ever do kick off again their gonna have air support along with state of the art weaponry 🤦‍♂️ how can anybody in their right mind be OK with this ?
574,Bruh I was tripping cause that look like a whole painting 😂
575,This man has no idea how much he is hated and despised. He hasn’t got a clue.
576,This Speech made him look silly. Hes just trying to talk himself out of the situation
577,"No, the assumption was that you would get ALL Americans out and that you wouldn’t hand over so much military equipment to the Tolly-Bon."
578,20 YEARS OF WAR FOR WHAT? IT'S A SHAME. POOR PEOPLE ABANDONED THERE ALONE WITH THE POWER OF SOME BARBARIANS....FOR WHAT? HOW DID THEY GET IN KABUL SO EASILY?
579,He’s a demented old man he needs to be court-martialed along with his party!
580,"Leave Americans, Service Animals, and 85 billion dollars of equipment. Well done Mr Magoo"
581,Democrats still believe this?
582,LMAO 🤣.  Every comment on here is trashing him.  Love it.  He won? LMAO 🤣.  Ya.  OK 👌
583,Absolutely disgraceful.
584,Get him out of there!!!!!
585,"Joe Biden: Senator during Saigon,
VP during Benghazi,
President as Kabul is taken"
586,I'm just glad this nightmare is over. Afghanistan is a failed state with no economy and infrastructure riddled with terroristic forces. That war would've never ended unless we committed a genocide
587,"I agree it was going to be messy but cmon man did you have to leave all our war junk to the durka durka durka's. blow up all our guns, vehicles and yes burn our uniforms."

592,Got money 4 WARS but can’t FEED THE POOR!
593,The worst lying speech I’ve ever heard.
594,Whats with all the dislikes?
595,"Biden is the ""L"" that keeps on giving."
596,"So we took 115,000 Afghans and 5,500 Americans = America last. Thanks Joe, NOT."
597,"ending? he didnt end s&$t , now this mess will never end ,"
598,This is how a President of the United States should sound like.
599,The United States ended 20 years of war in Afghanistan? Is that what happened?
600,"""Evceation"" can't even pronounce the damn teleprompter words!   What a disgrace blaming those you clearly left behind..""the world is changing"" what should change is you being  President Joe!"
601,4:00 this assumption was not accurate
602,"Evacuation Was a big mess; people who had no relation to USA or NATO members, nor were they any ""vulnerable persons"" (whatever they defined it), launched in the planes. Mostly young Afghans who were store owners."
603,When does this guy go to jail?
604,"Il reste que c'est un pays qui donneras encore longtemps une peur d'anarchie et une impression d'actes de violence, d’enlèvement et autres toujours possibles et imminent. Devenu plus près du monde ""en connaissance du pays par les médias et documentaires"" depuis cette ""guerre"" au terrorisme (et a la drogue ?). Redevenant isolés comme la plupart des pays de la .stan (terminaison de nom de pays - leurs associations, coalition tribale actuelle et anciennes peu documenté), coopérants des pays du nord et autres joignant possiblement une forces (manipulable, piratable par..?) déjà qu'asi renouvelée. Ce n'est plus un pays ou le tourisme viendras de si tôt, ce qui est un moins bien plus pour l'apport financier en $ étranger et cette coupures avec le monde, renouvelée. Situation nuisant présentement, certainement aux rêves de plusieurs qui se voyaient plus libéralistes dans une liberté individuelle a bâtir dans un pays en droits minimum et identité culturelle, comme les autres. Futur simples citoyens conscient, travailleurs individuels et naturels a la sociologie du pays s'éloignant peut-être un peu plus de leur exemple démocratique convoité ""a leurs manières"", mais se devant toujours d’être universellement compréhensible aux yeux du monde et en respect des droits individuels de la charte planétaire des droits humains -ONU. Dure de pensée démocratie et libre expression avec un pouvoir fermé et intouchable encourageant la culture de la drogues, donc indirectement ou directement ; de la corruption, charia ou pas (-2?)..."
605,"Every time he finished his presentation - he turns his back on all of us…. And, just walks away. How rude. I’m offended."
606,Joe needs to step down as President it’s the only logical solution
607,"Well you gotta give him credit for finding a way to ""end the war"" that ensures we'll be fighting in Afghanistan for another 20 years. Clever..."
608,"Ah, it is the previous guy's fault ..."
609,Well done 👍 Mr President. How it's feel to see a real President talk..
610,"Talking points to keep repeating.  It is all Trump's fault.  I only had two choices.  It was the right decision.  It is all Trump's fault.  ohh, and do not take any questions."
611,You have blood on your hands!!!!!   Lie's is all that comes out of your mouth!
612,Shame on Biden !
613,He’s even a bad liar !!
614,Is the border secure yet?
615,I'm just waiting for Dementia Joe to slip up and call them the 'tollypops'
616,Not to mention I gave the taliban $90B worth off our weapons. That should make us safer.
617,"9:40 They gave us a deadline....the USA a deadline.   So you negotiated with terrorists, and ran like a coward.  
We the people do not get threatened and run.  Commander and chief needs to step down to this cowardice"
618,"Those Afgan people didn't need to be evacuated, as the Taliban stated numerous times, they won't harm any of their people.
But I guess they will be loyal Democratic voters, so why not."
619,You can give free rides to afghans but not to US troops?
620,Headline should read “Biden discusses US full Surrender to taliban”
621,"3.5 trillion = 0, the border is secure and Afghanistan was a success... what an absolute clown."
622,They try to say his win was legit …how tf…?
623,As we literally abandoned Americans.  Why is this man not impeached!!
624,This man needs to be in a nursing home
625,Success?  I'd hate to see what he constitutes ad a failure....  How many left behind walk away Joe?
626,"RESIGN
EVERYONE FROM THIS ADMIN MUST RESIGN"
627,"Here is the deal that Trump made with the Taliban a deal that was good for America. It was a conditional exit from Afghanistan. In a nutshell.  First the Taliban had to reject Al-qaeda full stop. 2nd Afghans and Taliban come together and negotiate peace. 3rd, the US would have special forces on the ground during the process for counter terrorism. 4th, pres Trump told the Taliban leader himself that if American interests or an American was harmed he would unleash the full fury of the DOD on Afghanistan."
628,I don't usually run like a scared dog with my tail between my legs but when I do I make sure I run from the tollybon.
629,“Ending the war” or Talibans most successful war victory in history… 🤔
630,We know where our weapons caches are. We know where our vehicles are. We know where our aircraft is at. Why has Joe not cleaned that mess with drone and air strikes already?!?
631,Biden is our Great American President and telling the truth.
632,Amercuans lost war from those people who don't have even complete set of shoes in their feet
633,That's why you can't assume anything you have to know
634,"Its like a doctor coming to you and saying ""The surgery was successful, but the patient died"""
635,You did a poor job of getting out and left behind to many of our weapons.
636,Oh so the UN made another edict that no one will follow? That’s cool. I guess that “edict” will go with all the other ones on the desk.
637,Great decision by Biden. Loving the job my president is doing.
638,Notice how quiet the far left is right now.
639,Did he just say success of this mission???!!!
640,"Our American service dogs were left behind, abandoned on the streets of Kabul. What kind of administration does that?"
641,And yet all you could do was to talk about YOUR Son when you met with the families of those 13 fallen soldiers

655,"You didn't end the war, you just started an even bigger war. You will now fight for lost territory just like what happened in Vietnam (failed) and in Korea (sort of failed) History repeats itself. No wonder he said ""god bless our troops"" on inauguration day. May god help them."

660,"Wait... You  decided to end this? I thought you said ""Trump started this"". Which is it?"
661,"Biden you didn’t choose to end anything, that was Trump. But never underestimate Biden’s ability to take credit for what others set in motion. This dude is a disgrace to our country."
662,Biden gets on my nerves not answering questions. we need to get another president I think he needs to be impeached he not done anything to help the United States 😡😡😡 at least Trump  stood up for the people

678,"20 years ago: “Never Forget”
Now, Sleepy Joe: “What?”"
679,"I mean he rushes an evacuation for political reasons, leaves so many behind!!! Which leads to a suicide bombing and he has the nerve to blame the hostages.. I mean this is literally insanity!!!"
680,"I can't believe anything his speech writers say anymore.  Lies, twists, blaming others, wrong information......c'mon man."
681,"That old guy can't even walk correctly. Give him a wheelchair and roll him out of the white house. We need a new strong, confident president who will make other countries tremble."

684,You wasted our 85 billion dollar tax money🤬.Give my money back.
685,So what calendar is he looking at? Isn't there a month or 4 between May 1st and August 31st?.. how can you use that as your deadline when you passed it?
686,Does he ever not look at a screen?
687,I can't believe that this person is the President of the United States.

694,"He’s just tapping, does anyone even know what he’s talking about, dude has no energy, no charisma, no comprehension"
695,Why did you have to send 6000 troops back?  Shows that your entire withdrawal was a disaster..
696,So what about the 85 million dollars+ in supplies and vehicles? Must be a reason behind why dislikes are higher versus likes
697,It’s the blaming Trump for his screw ups for me
698,"Incidentally, the success of the Taliban in the occupied part of Syria, Idlib and Afrin, was enthusiastically celebrated by the Turkish and their allied Islamist terror groups and Islamist mercenary troops there!  Financed, equipped and supplied by Germany, the EU and the UN!"
699,we agreed the war must ended but we don;t agree with how you handle to end it.  Also what kind of American are you to get hundreds of afghanies out but left our fellows american behind????  Shame on you.
700,If we have so many terrorist organizations why do you have an open border Joe?  You just said your job is to protect Americans and the borders still open!!!!

721,What do the Biden supporters have to say now???
722,Everything Joe touches turns to crap.
723,No wonder his poll numbers are plummeting.
724,"He is incompetent, bring back mr trump"
725,He thinks he ended a war. He may of just started a new one.
726,"9:39 I thought the ""Buck"" stops with you! Why would you care what a fat orange man did before you? Your in charge, or maybe you forgot you were in charge."
727,The way he turns his back to all the questions and walks away just doesn’t sit right with me

734,The missing students from California? Who care right? Worst president ever
735,"Breathtaking.  This oh-so-feeble old man stumbling out and preening through a pack of lies.  Joe:  you did a terrible, awful, catastrophic job."
736,"Has he forgotten about 9/11? He knows that was the Taliban, right?"
737,malfeaceans? That was an insecure move.....you lie you lie you lie!
738,Wouldn't it be better for everyone to show text from the teleprompter instead of putting that poor actor on stage?
739,What will he screw up next?
740,"We are not all sheep, We will not believe these lies, WE KNOW THE TRUTH. WE THE PEOPLE."
741,"Joe Biden

752,"So much people dislike about literally anything these days, the war is finally over."
753,They must have pumped him up with some Methamphetamine. This guy is yelling today.  That or he just had a good nap.
754,"I need not tell you the perception around the world and in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, is that things are not going well in terms of the fight against the Taliban,” Biden said. And there is a need, whether it is true or not, there is a need to project a different picture.”"
755,Wow…I have no words for this one 🙄🙄🙄
756,"If people thought Trump's speeches were comical, Biden's speeches are just plain tragic. It is so cringe worthy to watch him trying to read the teleprompt. All these broken sentences and weird pauses. His mental capacity is not enough to even read coherently."
757,This guy sucks are you with me!? Bring Back the Donald enough of this!! 🤬
758,When he whispers at the end..its major creepy..creepster.

785,"""why wasn't this address done in prime-time?""...ever heard of sundowner's syndrome?"
786,"Interesting to consider how you would go about writing an address like that one.  It has to be about that length I imagine, given the loss of life and years of duration.  Kind of strange to bring in China and Russia as characters in the drama, not like they were big Taliban cheerleaders, so it ended with a bit of a “don’t worry, we still have enemies” kind of vibe.  May have been better to have said something about 20 years of negotiation with the Taliban and a recognition that our efforts and military sacrifice built a situation in which we could leave and thank the troops for that.  Good, big political address, delivery worked well, competent team demonstrated no matter where you fall on opinion."

Imagine Lord of the Rings, if the Ents didn’t attack Saruman in Isengard. Where would they be and where would the rest of Middle Earth be? As Merry states to Tree Beard “But you’re apart of this world! Aren’t you?” So I ask, aren’t we apart of this world?"

1166,"To Be honest, I think this is the best speech on contemporary events/ war that I have heard in my lifetime!  Far better than the vague platitudes of Obama, the bluster and bluff of Trump and the simplistic, asinine rhetoric of George W. Bush.  Everything Biden said here was accurate and based on reality, and he delivered it with sincerity and conviction.  Its time for America to focus on nation building here at home and not pursue a fools errand in the Middle East and Central Asia.  The USA needs to pivot to meet emerging challenges in Asia (China) and also mounting problems in America's own backyard such as securing the border with Mexico and poverty and refugee flows emanating from Latin America. I wholeheartedly think this speech by President Biden was the best I have heard him give in his entire political career!  Joe Biden's speech and policy was ""America First"" in action and not just mere platitudes like it was for his predecessor!  God bless you President Biden!"
1167,Biggest blunder of the decade

1202,Well Done!
1203,"Monsieur le Président vous avez pris une décision très courageuse, félicitation!"
1204,"Thank you America, this is what you voted for."
1205,he left the service dogs behind at the airport still locked in their cages :(
1206,That Right! Tell it like it is. USA did their part!👍
1207,"From Vietnam with love : Im a big fan of america until u, Biden :3 Before u, I believe The president of USA has to be smart and honest!"
1208,This was one one of his better speeches in my opinion.
1209,"We get it Joe...very few people disagree that we needed to leave Afghanistan...but you got it all ass backwards....the correct order is civilians, government staff, military..."
1210,This is crazy.  Is there anyone that believes a single word of this speech?
1211,How many people still feel good that they voted this guy in?
1212,You win the war all by yourself joe. I saw ya do it.
1213,20 years ago we should of just flew in a plane full of cash plus $80 billion dollars in weapons and equipment then called it a victory!  We’d be in the same place as now without all the death of our service men and civilians!
1214,"I get that they left a lot of aircraft, and military equipment but if you really think about it, how would’ve they move all they equipment over when they barely could could get any troupes/people out? If you look on the map the closes place to fly and lad with out refueling is India maybe ? Then to get a cargo ship to haul all the equipment back would be smart but hard, that’s the plan I would’ve done, but I would’ve still probably left the tanks because they drive pretty slow and I think there isn’t many gas stations on the way to India anyway."
1215,Insanity: repeating the same BS over and over expecting a different result.
1216,if they had the means to and change the landscape of everything - what do the Taliban want the world to look like?  would it be modern?  science based?  or relatively archaic?
1217,I like the part where he tried to sound tough lol you think anyone is afraid of this guy? He wont remember what he said 5 minutes after.
1218,who votes for joe to move to Afghanistan?
1219,"Bagram U.S. military base was located in the neighborhood of Kabul Airport.
Withdrawing the base here in July was the biggest failure of this time."
1220,Could we get joe to eat a apple !  No more ice cream -- he gets brain freeze  that lasts for days !
1221,"Yes Mr President, no nation in the history has done so. You have  bettered your records of Korea and Vietnam."
1222,Biden had the balls that any other president didn’t have.
1223,🙏
1224,Was it 85 million votes that put this guy in the White House? How can 85 million people be so wrong?
1225,If the Buck stops with Joe he sure blamed a lot of people.
1226,All I know is that many politicians of both parties including president trump and Obama promised to bring the troops back home from Afghanistan if elected and many either tried or failed to do so and President Biden kept that promise. You may agree or disagree with him but he kept his promise.
1227,Walked up to podium quite nimbly
1228,Everybody has a solution till its your turn to apply it people have blind folds on and only see one side
1229,Your resignation or 25th amendment will make Nixon look like a misdemeanor 😂😂😂
1230,"Not criticizing a withdrawal, that's debatable but this must be the most incompetent military operation in US history!!"
1231,"They will go back when Lockheed-Martin says so. 
And DC will be like YES MASTER!"
1232,"Guys, if you listen to it at 1.25x speed he sounds super healthy"
1233,If YOU 'made the decision to end this war' what does your predecessor have to do with it?
1234,"Jie, thanks for the freaking BS,  destroyed Afghanistan n killed lots of innocent Afghans. That didn't mean a thing."
1235,WE STILL HAVE TROOPS IN IRAQ BRING THEM HOME TOO!!!
1236,He. DID NOT. end it.
1237,#ImpeachBiden
1238,It took him 2:15 to walk to the damn podium.
1239,You let America down Joe.
1240,This and $4.00+ a gallon of gas because some people freaked out over some tweets.
1241,Over twice as many dislikes as likes. There may yet be hope for this country...
1242,Starts as 14th second after 2nd minute ends.
1243,Nice job reading Joe.  You get a extra pudding tonight....
1244,The only winners here are the contractors and businesses that exploited the situation based on the self done 9/11
1245,"Joe, just turn the teleprompter around so we can read it"
1246,Him taking his mask off before his speech had me laughing…. We all know he put that thing on 2 seconds before he entered.
1247,"Its hard to tell but, is he STILL reading a teleprompter??"
1248,"he will not be elected for second term, mark my words"
1249,The penalty for treason is death.
1250,"It’s just so sad.  He’s just not able. He’s not calling the shots, but he’s not even up to whatever he’s signed up for.  Someone didn’t love him enough to tell him not to run."
1251,How about he deliver on any kind of promise made
1252,Listen at 1.25x speed
1253,I like it when wars end. Good job.
1254,"The first 2 minutes of video is nothing, did the president get lost? Glad someone steered him in the right direction."
1255,"He got us out, but left US citizens stranded there, weapons to our enemies and 12 soldiers are now dead.... great job.... what an idiot!"
1256,So far from truth!  This guy is able to lie or mumble on que!
1257,O bama support it !
1258,Trump 2024
1259,How people can still support this guy is just unbelievable.  Sheep are sheep though.
1260,Largest airlift in history is not something to brag about
1261,Where is everybody on the left yelling how great this Airlift was I don't hear anybody
1262,"It is utterly amazing to see this disaster of a president pretend like he is not only successful, but exceedingly so. This life-long establishment fool is a complete failure. This is political desperation personified. My god this is a level of gaslighting is a new level. This is insane."
1263,reaching for a second term that you will not get 🤡
1264,Whats worse getting hacked and bugged for a year in one of the most guarded places on earth on trumps watch or what's going on in Afghanistan
1265,what's he saying????   he is all over the place-- you botched it Joe. you botched it--- you left a whole Air Force.  you LEFT people.   he's just bragging.      who loses and brags that they won
1266,"Doesn't matter which potus it was Or did to pull all US troops out, you're damned if you do and your damned if you don't."
1267,81 million votes. I just don't understand.
1268,I am still confuse why American people vote for this type of President ?
1269,"Left our expensive equipment in that country. Maybe it was part of a deal, really bad decision 🙄"
1270,I hope the people that voted this type of nonsense back into power are happy. Was a border wall and stupid tweets really that bad?
1271,You ended one and started another you my be the president but your the face of our country and you made America look weak as hell ty you embarrassed all of us
1272,Losing* the war.
1273,Comment section is insane. Why are you guys so offensive? You realize you are being just as bad if not worse than the presidents committing these acts? You’re either reactively fighting or supporting their narrative without coming up with your own.
1274,watch this on 1.5x thank me later
1275,Another useless speech by “Walk-Away Joe”
1276,"I see a re occurring theme here with Democratic politicians.  Remember Bengazhi??? So quickly we forget, but that was about a movie isn’t that what sleepy Joe and Obama claimed?"
1277,"I need Trumph!!!
Now the people realize how important Trumph is !!!"
1278,"it's just too bad no one else in the world is willing to help US... we have to fly across seas to make these efforts, where are the people who surround their land?"
1279,"He is taking credit for getting 100,000 plus people out but we did not do it on our own. England and France had troops on the ground. Countries around the world took in the refuges. He sounds like Trump stealing glory for himself instead of taking responsibility for screwing up the drawdown. At the end he mentioned his son Beau and his service. beau died of cancer for which I am truly sorry but at least he wasn't blown to pieces like many of our soldiers in Afghanistan. And he was awarded the Bronze Star. This is a medal for valor during combat against the enemy, but Beau di not participate in any combat actions. He was just another Biden taking credit for the actions of others. The Bidens' need to go."
1280,I am here for the comments. I can’t listen to this guy anymore.
1281,He needs to fall on some lead
1282,Man can't even keep his likes count higher than dislikes and we are expected to believe he is the most popular US president in history? Gimme a break!!!! Come on man!!!!!
1283,"instead of blaming your president, blame the Afghan forces who didn't fight and surrenderd everything after all that training and money that has been spent, Shame on you!"
1284,Thank you president Biden for finally doing what was long overdue.
1285,"There has never been a weaker, more worthless bag of wind in our presidency that this bumbling bag of Alzheimer’s."
1286,Wheres his voters at?
1287,I can't stand even hearing him talk I swear it's something with a flesh costume trying to act human he is disgusting
1288,You still blame the Afghans? You didn't really learn any lesson.
1289,"poor joe, he's just a baby. harris ! can you give joe some chocolat milk, i'm sure he would love it."
1290,$86 billion gift given to the Taliban... this is just the beginning.
1291,Reality check -- Joe Biden ???
1292,"So basically you have got your ass kicked for 20 years! 
And because you liked it so much you also had to engineered 911..."
1293,Look over his shoulder Military Flags gold fringe. Marshal-Law. Commander and chief : Russell-Jay: Gould.
1294,Wait so he literally just admitted that it was Trump's plan to leave Afghanistan and not his and really he's been saying it was his idea all along period but still somehow it was Trump's fault for the withdrawal
1295,"""Its the people's fault. They don't want to come out.""

""Its Trump's fault."""
1296,"120k evacuated in short time. It could happen only one way, using the strategy of chaos. hahahaha"
1297,How can anybody believe biden
1298,"Dude, ending the war was great but ffs the execution was horrible."
1299,It's not ended... we just quit. This mf incompetent af
1300,"I cannot believe the people who looked at this and said, ""Wow, I want you to be my president"" What an absolutely pathetic excuse for a man let alone president."
1301,2:04   are you ready for  this 28:33
1302,"Physically, mentally, and morally dead  President ....."
1303,"""we will hunt you down and WE will pay"" 😂😂😂"
1304,"Reading these comments gives me a glimpse of hope in the American people. For the first time after reading comments for hours I have not found 1 person on his side. Maybe we can take our country back and stop this communistic incompetent takeover. FIGHT BACK PEOPLE ITS OUR COUNTRY!!! isnt also stated ""to protect against ALL threats foreign and domestic."" doesnt really matter the time period."
1305,1.5 speed 👀 he sounds as though like a normal paced human being
1306,"HE TALKS ABOUT ""CORRUPTION""!!!!!"
1307,Thanks biden obama
1308,These comments are filled with republicans 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1309,POV: You came for these comments.
1310,Lol of course it's Trump fault !! Lol  joe is on a lot of caffeine  ! Lol what a  joke
1311,if we stop giving out armaments to Afghan.. that'd be great
1312,how was it in any way a success
1313,"look what american did in afghan in past 20 years, and how people's life getting much better in xinjiang,china. they both islamic region"
1314,"Why is he yelling?
Is he scolding the American people?
He used a kinder tone with the Kabul terrorists."
1315,Guy wants credit for filling planes with random Afghans who now are our responsibility.
1316,Never perpetrate this joke.
1317,what an embarrassment
1318,Mr 10%
1319,"Joe, you know nothing about the real military experience!"
1320,"""I made the decision to end this war""

Nah BRUH, TRUMP DID! You sure messed it up though."
1321,What an absolute shitshow!
1322,God bless Joe
1323,There's something lurking in his undies.
1324,still a scripted speech. walkaway JOE is as sincere and transparent as a rock. almost 50years of public service to fill his pockets
1325,"Old joe gave up and didn't wanna get involved

why did my family chose this old man for president and yes they are Mexican and think trump is bad and Biden is good :/"
1326,Is it me or does he squint to read that teleprompter
1327,totally not looking at a reading card that was written for him... lol his eyes are so dead locked on what he is reading.... every time he pauses for a second he has this look on his face like he is lost and or trying really hard not to loose his place on whatever he is reading..... i would take this a little more serious if he maybe looked at the camera once....and didn't make it so obvious that he is just reading something that was written for him... it feels so ungenuine when he does not even look at the camera you can tell they got the camera and the reading cards positioned the right way so it looks like he is looking at the camera but you can tell in his eyes that he is trying really hard to read or well read and make it sound like a good speech like Obama use to give...
1328,I Took a POOP Earlier that had more INTELLIGENT Thoughts 🤮
1329,"I wanted to pay attention, but I couldn't. I got sleepy."
1330,"All I hear is him saying... ""please believe me, I really tried hard to do good, guys."" Pitiful and pathetic. Weakest leader in the history of leaders."
1331,No human right if not Dems.
1332,Chump can't even be on time for his own briefing.
1333,"Never taking responsibility, always blaming others. If it was a success you know for sure he’d make it known it was under his administration 🙄"
1334,"""I pooped my pants"""
1335,"He left the dogs behind as well. 
Where's the outrage. ."
1336,There’s a significant difference between ending a war and losing one.

1342,Advance it 2.16 minutes.
1343,"Once a politician, always a politician. His Alzheimer's must've made him forget how much of a disaster he caused. Who knows, he's probably gone senile."
1344,Sounds like 20 minutes of excuses. He doesnt want to save the americans still there.
1345,I feel so much better knowing that within 3 years we will be right back in there!!!
1346,"Yes they did a great job, despite your horrific leadership! Just imagine what they could have done without you!"
1347,"0.0015 seconds. World record for the fastest video paused. Now, straight to comments."
1348,"It’s like he is still campaigning…Joe the election is over buddy, stop telling everyone what your going to do and just do it before the bad guy has a chance to capitalize on your plan. Seriously, this guy is more focused on playing politics and kissing the butts of his voting base rather than quietly implementing any tactic or strategy without broadcasting his next move."
1349,"You did not end the war stupid, all you did was start the next one!"
1350,Does anyone really believe what he is saying? Like for real i want to know?
1351,"not gonna lie, didn't watch any of this rubbish. but i did notice he put on his mask while walking back into his house, lol"

1369,Treason
1370,"forgetting obvious problems with what he said.. basically, it was an emotional plea.. well, seems America thinks the world runs on its emotions.. let's see how that plays out.. within 10 years we're gonna have trouble over this on a large scale, but at least the house plant preached platitudes at us for 20 minutes.. don't we all feel better?"
1371,Trump signed a deal. But he didn't say leave like a humiliated bunch. At least leave with dignity..jeez. 80+ billion dollars of equipment left behind wow 😂
1372,"Blaming Trump again, ok. Ffs"
1373,Sleeping 😴 sleeping 😴 😴
1374,Him and his teleprompter 🤨😏🙄
1375,What an accomplishment! You should be so proud JOEY BOY.What a BAFFON! How bout The Americans you left behind
1376,"yeah this guy is useless lmao, also just send an ICBM and the afghan problem is solved"
1377,Thank you President Biden!  I believe you and I support this decision 100%
1378,"Are you looking for a spell caster who can help you grant your wishes.
I recommend you to DR OKOLO  on his youtube channel."
1379,We’re idiots.
1380,"As he was walking away there was probably someone in the doorway saying""This way, joe, this way""."
1381,Despicable Joe trying to turn this into a win for himself.  JoeBiteme you cost us 13 American Souls needlessly.
1382,ရ
1383,what a joke.
1384,"If American civilians and Afghan allies are left behind, the war in Afghanistan is NOT over!"
1385,Afghans should be furious. Suggesting the Afghan government just handed over the country to their enemies is a vicious characterization of what occurred and a complete abdication of his responsibility to tell the truth.
1386,he sounds lnormal at 1.25 playback
1387,"This guy is a complete joke, everyone who voted for him has to be regretting their decision"
1388,Finally a president who gets us out of wars. Biden for reelection 2024.  Greatest POTUS ever!!!
1389,"LIES, and MORE LIES"
1390,"""we will not forgive, we will not forget"" how very catholic of you Joe"

1393,If trump still president he handle  better than sleepy joe😂
1394,FOS AS A CHRISTMAS TURKEY
1395,Never seen CNBC comments this harsh towards Biden. It’s well deserved and long over due. No leader is above criticism
1396,disgusting!
1397,This guy is a joke
1398,Pathetic
1399,F biden
1400,Damn it’s been almost a year and he NEVER takes questions
1401,"NO Mr President...You GAVE afghanistan to China on a Silver Plate, because China told yo so, because China needs the Lithium and other resources of Afghanistan."
1402,A lot of dislikes
1403,"The smooth steam syntactically sneeze because treatment customarily smell throughout a encouraging polish. well-to-do, open hourglass"
1404,POS
1405,"New title, how not to withdraw from a conflict when you’re the only one who call timeout"
1406,13 Soldiers did not “give” their lives. You TOOK their lives.
1407,Isis K huh what's it going to be next Isis Z
1408,disgusting
1409,The world is changing and we’re becoming a weak link thanks to Sleepy J and this entire snowflake era!
1410,You were at Dover airport checking your watch. Seeing how quick you could get away from the shame even an empty shell of a man like you must feel somewhere in what remains of your soul. Those 13 caskets are on you Joe on you.
1411,Worst EVER.
1412,What a potato
1413,Lunatic
1414,I can't even stand to look at him... he not only betrayed his own country but betrayed his ally countries too...
1415,Here we come with his son beau again— let him Rest In Peace— no wonder hunter acts like he does— daddy loved beau more than him!
1416,Bla bla
1417,My comment was censored
1418,So seeing the dislikes and reading all these comments I’m having it difficult to see how Biden could have won over trump wired 😷
1419,Thank God we finally have a real President!!!
1420,“Unparalleled results” that’s for sure
1421,Good job!👍
1422,I think he did a great job
1423,"""Peace in our time""."
1424,You know they’re scared when they’re saying good things about the USA instead of bashing it
1425,If he feels so passionately  about our military what did he have so important that he had to keep checking his watch while they were unloading those flag draped coffins of our heros
1426,"everyday just gets better and better with this man in office.
Open, Biden..."
1427,Now he's proud of himself
1428,"His delivery will always be off but he is generally spot on. All policy speeches are theater. That includes posturing, de amino zing and virtue signaling. There will always be fluff. I’m just glad to hear and hopeful for follow through on the diversion from a foreign policy heavily reliant on the military and regime change . The best tribute we can give to war veterans is to stop being so eager create more of them. A truly great nation will have greater success influencing the world through our character and relationships rather than by force and warfare."
1429,I can't believe this is happening .
1430,Well we finally have a bipartisan understanding on something. This was an absolute train wreck.
1431,Freedom to Afghanistan
1432,I especially admire American politicians who can speak so full of justice and sense of mission about the shameless things they have done and are doing. This is America.
1433,I am not so sure that turning your back to the enemy is a wise decision.
1434,He extended the war from May 1st to August 31st but couldn't extend it again? 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣😂🤣😂
1435,So proud of the largest airlift in history.. meanwhile it wouldn't have ever been necessary if he hadn't royally screwed up .. 🤦‍♀️
1436,"Putin takes questions from the press but Biden doesn't
Says a lot"
1437,"I am tired of Americans who do not see anything good about this country. I congratulate our troops who carried out an extraordinary mission. I do not believe any country in the world would have pulled the feat of air lifting that number of people within such a short period. My condolences to the families of the troops who died just before the mission ended, I bet it is painful to them. "
1438,"Pulling out is one thing. How irresponsibly done it was another, and it was very poorly done.  And this war is not finished. This fool will never own up to his mistake to his grave."
1439,"wow, good job /s"
1440,"Thank you for leaving the Taliban and China with a large amount of weapons and cash, airplanes, armored vehicles, and a large number of military dogs; Biden, thank you"
1441,"NBC
CNN
MSNBC
FB"
1442,Biden: I forgot.. what is Afghanistan again?
1443,Work to help the people leave that are supposed to be trained to defend their home
1444,"We have ""endless military deployments"" all over the world. We have troops and bases in Germany but no one says we're still fighting WWII."
1445,Sleepy Joe is very good at reading from a teleprompter...never let his eyes off of it for one sec....this is your POTUS
1446,"Nice, create your own fire and praise yourself of the outcome, nice job politician."
1447,To be honest we should glass them once we are out
1448,someone needs to be held accountable for this!! Senators and representatives please I beg you impeach this man. He is destroying this country .
1449,Oh dang he did make it. But wait let them tell him what to say
1450,He didn’t end it just started what a nut case
1451,my gut tells me i cant trust this guy
1452,Why do Biden’s speech writers have to make it sound like he is admitting defeat? “We completed our mission” should have been enough and at least somewhat reassuring. This  one sounds like he just finished a marathon he didn’t sign up for. How many apologies does one need to give? Not the words of a leader.
1453,"We all recall that Trump brokered this deal, right? Trump negotiated with the Taliban and made a deal with them (Feb 29th 2020) to pull US troops out of Afghanistan by May of 2021. Biden actually agreed with Trump on this, only it took him a little bit longer. Obviously the ramifications have been tragic. RIP to the service men and women and blessings and consolation to their families, friends and loved ones. That goes without saying."
1454,Really we should have been out of Afghanistan a long time ago
1455,"""Human rights are the centre of our foreign policy ""
So lets give away a country to terrorists 😂😂.
Very humane."
1456,I thought he decided to leave in April. They asked American citizens to leave since March? Hmmmm?
1457,giving the enemy a bunch of high grade weapons isnt ending anything.. LOL
1458,💞💕 I AM PROUD OF MY PRESIDENT AND I AM PROUD OF MY COUNTRY TODAY. Thank you President Biden
1459,This who y’all liberals voted for😂
1460,20 services members were wounded in a peaceful extraction from Afghanistan? That doesn't sound like the taliban was help extract are soldiers like you promised they'd do.
1461,"SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}

us  help  us  all   always   and  expose  evil  always  ."
1462,Does this mean we get a tax cut now that we ain't spending all that money?
1463,"When it comes to Afghan people Americans should stay quiet. 🤔
You have no idea what they went through. 
Be helpful and giving. 
Thanks"
1464,"A  totally destructive  sucess 
..... what is the meaning of  then martyrdom  of thousands  of Americans  soldiers  in Afghanistan 🇦🇫..    u must respect ur soldiers  sacrifice...  real truth  is America  is responsible  for whatever the crises in Afghanistan  if I talk politically  .......u dnt have  to leave the Afghanistan  and the people over there in such horrible  crises........"
1465,"He can’t take responsibility, his handlers wouldn’t allow that."
1466,"lets tell everyone what we're doing and how on live TV and wonder why it wont work, I'm sure that will teach those mean old talibans."
1467,81 million votes
1468,He sure end it with a taliban blast
1469,My favorite president is Thomas Jefferson he looks like a daddy!!! FR AMERICAN VIBEZ!
1470,I’m so sorry to all those who died and are stuck behind enemy lines. I’m so sick and tired of this guy. I’m sick and tired of seeing evil. I want to see everyone happy and breaking bread with each other. Not this. God bless you all!
1471,NO QUESTIONS…. EVER!
1472,We did it to Japan
1473,He deserves a Columbian necktie.
1474,This guy is sickening to listen to.
1475,Of course can't be a leader and admit this was his decision.
1476,"Don’t blame me, I voted Trump"
1477,hes staring at a script this whole video lol
1478,"Way to refuse to even say Trump’s name, or did Biden forget his name?"
1479,Blood on Democrats hands.
1480,This is what happens leaders are chosen by identiy instead of abilities.
1481,"""A STRATEGIC RETREAT"""
1482,Reading a script without the means to understand what he is saying.  Remove him.
1483,And We should keep supporting AT-ali-ban supporter and servant of Xiden with our money 💪
1484,"BEST DECISION EVER!!

DEMOCRATS 2022!!

1485,He puts the mask on 2 seconds before walking out and takes it off… such a fraud
1486,"Kamala "" We Did It Joe"""
1487,Shameful!!
1488,These are the lowest amount of views I’ve ever seen - I think we all can see what’s going on here no applause either that is the quietest entrance ever into a room ! Wait Technically aren’t you supposed to be sworn in on a certain date ? That didn’t happen and hasn’t for a while.  I suggest you all do your research because these may be all actors.
1489,I wonder which God were you referring that bless this country and protect our troops? You need to clarify it is not the God who allows abortion of the unborn children. Hypocrisy at its best!!!
1490,He literally blamed those left behind for not making it out. What a twisted individual. Resign Biden.
1491,"Wait a minute, now he’s saying they prepared for it when days ago he said nobody could have seen this coming and nobody suggested it could even happen?"
1492,Thats was the weirdest speech ive ever seen
1493,كل عم يحربو عم ياكل من ورا طهرنا ليش انتو وحوش٢ مانكوم بشر اعملو شي امنيح مشان الله يطول بعمرك
1494,You're doing the right things.... May God bless you...
1495,The saddest part is Biden lost the election and we just stood by helplessly on Wednesday and Thursday and Friday as they fixed the election results....totally unheard of in the history of US Presidential elections
1496,Afghanistan is saturated in resources other than oil
1497,We know joe....YOU FAILED AGAIN!
1498,I cannot stand all of you here in the comments. We should stand by our president in a time like this. Man made the right decision.
1499,"Joe, I wouldn't trust you to save your action figures from the bathtub drain. If this is your idea of an 'extraordinary success', then I am terrified to know what constitutes a failure in your book."
1500,"Again Mr MAGOO doesn't take any questions from the press. Just like the other day looking at his watch, he's in a hurry to catch the early bird special.at Cafe Milano."
1501,what happen to the hitlist that he mention?
1502,All I heard was lie after lie in every single sentence he said...!!
1503,Sooo we’re just gonna ignore everyone who was left behi- strand- stayed there 100% by choice?
1504,You left a lot of goodies there Biden! CHRISTMAS  will come early when you ALL get your kickbacks!! It's  about the money! You don't  care about people!
1505,When did ya'll start being concerned about spending?
1506,He pulled out of Afghanistan cause it was over 18 years old
1507,"Who won 
Draw?"
1508,"We have airlifted 100,000 Afghans!!!??? So where are they now!!?? Who is paying for them?"
1509,#impeach the potato!!!
1510,"I guess its nice ""they"", whom ever ""they"" are, finally ""let"" him talk about Afghanistan. What a joke he is."
1511,Чоооо он говорит; 1.09.21; я не понел. Я знаю что Россия и Киргизия= 😘
1512,How many dem voters  out there watching this today were secretly missing Trump 🤔
1513,I'd rather spend 300 million dollars a day on our vets & their families.
1514,"His numbers keep climbing 
More then 100,000
10's of thousands 
Over 120,000 haha"
1515,I feel like I lose brain feels listening to this guy
1516,Uncle is a marine and let’s just say Biden isn’t being thanked after what happened.
1517,Can I have same Talibans  deal.  I would leave usa for 3 trillions dollars  and fully army baes and air forces base.
1518,Old dude is out to lunch lmao!
1519,Resident biden needs to RESIGN NOW!!!!!!
1520,The service dogs were in their crates starving to death
1521,This guy truly is pathetic. This is who this country voted for. Great job a true travesty
1522,"You belong to a home, by no means have anything to offer as a president!"
1523,"Thumbs down you are very missed lead group and hopefully you’ll gain insight into communism and what a democracy is and how proves you to be free. Material , physical, and spiritual. To have a democracy there must be a balance. My prayer is we all rise to assist One another and our government. Because without looking at a balance America will have lost it’s most great place in the world. And that is to maintain its honor and trust and freedom. The cautious difference because we could very easily fall in to the one area we do not need to be in and that would be looking at material Thinking. . Think carefully."
1524,"""we are out of Afghanistan for  good""  ........""I will hunt you down..I will come for you """
1525,That was rough.
1526,"Why does he keep repeating the thing about Trump agreeing to May 1st? He's admitting he's the one that broke the agreement but then seems to be imply that makes it Trump's fault.
This is like the 4th time he's said it too.
Complete incompetence."
1527,"biden should give his speech to his people, go give the speech in afghanistan to the taliban."
1528,Thats weird my friend is being deployed to Afghanistan soon. It maybe just a small army now i dunno but his not happy about it.
1529,"Go to bed, old man,you always look sleepy."
1530,"Stop with the blame game, stop with your pathetic ""tough guy"" voice.  The people advising you should be fired and you, Mr. President should be honorable and admit your failure to execute a plan that would have resulted is a different outcome.  An outcome that would have saved lives, saved the US reputation, and ensured the safety of future terrorist threats.  Stop patting yourself on the back...this was a historical debacle that you lead and will be forever remembered by."
1531,Speechcraft -69
1532,I want my money back.
1533,I want my money back.
1534,"It too late, sleepyJoe."
1535,"He has such a hard time reading the teleprompter properly, he doesn't even process what he is saying in real time... That's why it seems so robotic... The man has no clue but what he was instructed to do.."
1536,"The fantastic decision intrinsically serve because cocoa morally apologise behind a phobic carol. zealous,  freezing badge"
1537,What a fool…prison…murderer !
1538,"Success??? ""Oh brother THIS GUY STINKS!!!"""
1539,He thinks this is leadership.

1542,Your a killer those soldiers blood is in your hands
1543,"trump would have handled this much better, he would have had a press conference like he did in Helsinki handing over power to the American Taliban."
1544,He is clueless
1545,Damn you! We deserve answers. And to turn your back on us yet again is beyond unacceptable!
1546,"All he is here is the messenger... others wrote every word of it. But I have to admit, I only made it to the 4 minute mark as I can't stand listening to him any longer than that."
1547,That man is a f*cking joke. There is no way he is actually in charge. He is certainly not in control.
1548,#Joebidenisakiller
1549,Looking at your watch as the caskets came out of the plane.. so much lies..
1550,Don't you know the people behind the curtain are terrified the whole time he is in front of the cameras?  They hold their breath just knowing he is going to say something completely insane or possibly falling on his way to or from the lectern.
1551,Thank you Mr. President! You did as good as could be expected under the circumstances. Thank you for clarifying to all those that were worshipping him instead of paying attention to what he was doing that hindered this operation. Folks are so spoiled that they don't consider how immense this whole situation was and why were put in it. You say it clearly they just don't want to hear anything that contradicts their partisan political stances.
1552,These are the lowest views I have ever seen
1553,"Gotta love the empty podium for 2 minutes, are they trying to tell us something?"
1554,2 trillion dollar and then lose. classic united states
1555,"I’m surprised he wasn’t checking his watch!
“Hmmm is it pudding time soon”?"
1556,Great Satan
1557,Disgraceful…
1558,"Ummmm... that's a green screen, folks. The sound of the camera shutters were added in. This is insane."
1559,are we living in reverse bizarro world? I can't even watch this I'm two minutes in and I've already thrown up in my mouth twice
1560,"Here is some insight:

This is how the Democrats talk to groups of minorities. First it is the mix messaging, speaking truths out of context so you doubt your own opinion, add a personal connection (ex: my so served), and lastly quote either MLK or Lincoln…"
1561,"What a loser. We all know he didn't win. &who is the ""they""who don't let him speak? Man has 0power over us. STOP COMPLYING IT'S OUR RIGHT. NO PASSPORTS IF BUSINESSES SAY NO!"
1562,"Hes a liar! He said half the country was Taliban when we trained 300,000 Afghanistan soldiers and there were only 70,000 Taliban."
1563,Complete disgrace to America.
1564,"Love how cnn, YouTube, FB, Insta, and all media outlets are giving this Biden the clown is getting a pass. What a joke."
1565,"If his lips are moving he's lieing. I notice whenever they talk about how many they got out,  they never say where they put them, nor how they will be vetted. Please Pray for the  left behind Americans and Afghans, that we can rescue them."
1566,"he did right,  that was a never ending war, the bush family war"
1567,Democrats 🙄

1571,This is a sham. And a shame.
1572,"he always brings up his sons military experience when he brings up the war. Beau was an Army officer as a Lawyer, not a fighter. His son didn't even die in combat or because of a service related injury. Additionally, he was in the National Guard and was not Active Duty."
1573,One of the most deceitful speeches ever delivered by a president of the USA!
1574,សួស្តី
1575,Obiden attempts to talk while living a lie that’s why he laughs
1576,Various feeling sigh*

1632,"As the English is my third language, I found Biden’s speech is much more easy to understand than any other President’s speech."
1633,Biden gave an excellent speech. Could not have been better. And I agree with him.
1634,Why bother ending what you started
1635,Yeah he was at the base when the 13 service men and women's caskets arrived. He checked his watch about 13 times while they were being unloaded from the plane. He's an embarrassment to this country and the whole world knows it.
1636,Where are the 80 million who voted for him? I don't see any support here.
1637,Go to the bed clown 🤡🤡👎
1638,"Joe 90% is good on a math test, not good when you are talking about saving lives. You make Tump look like a reliable ally and truth teller."
1639,Ugh
1640,You abandoned the Afghan people to die and destroyed our reputation with our other allies for cynical political points. Disgusting.
1641,Great speech
1642,"Great, lucid, speech. Right side of history"
1643,"At long last.
A cup of coffee in the a.m. to help change the things we can.
A glass of wine at the end of the day (a parting glass to those who sacrificed) .....to accept the things we will never change."
1644,A real President only takes responsibility for doing the right thing when one decides to admit that their faculties are sadly in decline for that is not just the responsible thing to do nor is it not only the bravest thing to do but more importantly it's the Presidential thing to do above all else despite of collosal failure!!!
1645,I see the fool in chief is a windbag too when he wants to be.
1646,"I love when this channel has so many dislikes, keep em coming boys"
1647,"Thousands dead, tens of thousands of our vets suffering from PTSD, billions of dollars spent, 20+ years of fighting, an entire generation of soldiers, and all that progress got erased practically within a month."
1648,Simply put- a blow hard
1649,"have you ever pulled the supports out from under a building? what happens is the building collapses, same thing happened in Afghanistan we pulled everything out at once and the government we had set up collapsed, should have had a staggered pull out, given the afghani government a chance to stand on its own legs."
1650,"Wow... avoided questions, again.
Sad just sad. What a flop he pulled on this whole plan. He skipped so many steps in the plan to save money, or what? I don't get the reason, why so fast and unplanned at all?"
1651,"We didnt end the war we were pushed out, we lose."
1652,"Great speech and I agree with our President.

 Haters triggered"
1653,We have a pandemic going on in the United States mr president we are tired of hearing about Afghanistan
1654,♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1655,"Make sure you go to the ""The White House"" YouTube channel and give the video a thumbs down."
1656,omg WE NEED TRUMP BACK IN OFFICE 2024
1657,God help us all
1658,He says no nation was able to pull off an airlift of this magnitude. I don think that’s something to be proud of. Sorry Mr. President you failed
1659,"For those who gave a thumbs down to this executive decision... you are now on your own...independently...to fight your own battles.
May your God be with you."
1660,"If EVEN ONE American who wanted to leave was left behind, the mission IS NOT COMPLETE.  And you, Mr. President, are guilty of abandoning the American people."
1661,That blank stare...
1662,He didnt end it just turned it to a new chapter
1663,28:37 is what Americans stranded in Afghanistan see.
1664,Like/dislike ratio make me happy 😊
1665,I didn’t vote for him. I knew he was gonna be a disaster.
1666,Can NOT stomach the sight of this guy.
1667,"Biden did well to PREVENT further US casualties. To all nay sayers, if one of ur relatives was in Afghanistan, u would b glad Biden brought them back safe to the US. The US did EVERYTHING they could in 20 years to strengthen the Afghan military, but it was for nothing. The Taliban knew Afghan military was weak, so they took over very fast. Not many other countries wanted to help, AND it is impossible to bring millions of Afghans to the US. Afghans just need to start praying to our Heavenly Father, so real change in their can happen."
1668,"Its disgusting how he’s strutting around all proud thinking that hes singlehandedly ended the war in Afghanistan, not realizing or not caring about how many citizens and ambassadors and politicians from other countries disapprove with his methods, and have pointed out what a disgusting failure this operation was."
1669,Wow great
1670,The most votes ever folks...unreal
1671,Instead of being happy that American lives will no longer be risked in afghan. Most of the comments here are ignorance at its finest.
1672,"""81 Million Votes"""
1673,Insert Obama here and you have the same speech!
1674,"He keeps saying, My predecessor this and that"". At what point do you take responsibility for what was done half a year into your presidency? Did Trump draw up your game plan for removing the troops? Did Trump make sure you, during your presidency, not just drag people out of the country before you left? Did Trump make you leave 85 billion in US arms and equipment? There are a ton of questions we can ask. Its basically not that we left. Its HOW we left that really makes me angry."
1675,Unbelievable that he's still trying to pull the Trump card . . .  Unbelievable . . . .
1676,"What a disgrace, I don't care what your party affiliation is but Joe and Kamala need to resign. There are still AT LEAST 100-200 Americans over there that want to come home. What happened to nobody left behind. RESIGN OR IMPEACH!"
1677,Thank God for Biden. He did a perfect job.
1678,I know its sad that people died on that day but 13 of our own could have been prevented.
1679,Viva Trump!!
1680,This man is pathetic and must be removed for the security of our great nation
1681,The military industrial complex was the only winner in this one.   20 years of profits.   I'm sure those stocks paid well.
1682,"1% sleepy Jo
What a leader 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
1683,Wars and occupations are ugly and painful. Putting an end to them is always a great thing to do.
1684,"No guts...  just know how to take credit and avoid holding of responsibility...  Ah,  how can you expect a virtue from a thief?"
1685,So a birdy tells me you even abandoned the dogs too.
1686,He defeated MIC
1687,"To me, sounds like Obama. Right around 19:00"
1688,Sounds like a blame game to me 🤷🏽‍♂️
1689,Has anyone ever mentioned a Military Coup?
1690,You killed them .you should not be allowed to attend there funeral.
1691,Silent cameras should be a thing
1692,"Dear @JoeBiden, 
      First of all, great speech. 
Next I’d like the applaud you and your administration. I am very proud of everything you accomplished in Afghanistan."
1693,"The Afghan Army collapsed because they felt betrayed and demoralized by how the US Military sneaked out of the country in the middle of the night not telling anyone. If the Americans are running away from the Taliban, how would anyone expect the Afghan army to stay and fight a regime that made America soldiers go running back to their mommies?"
1694,Poor old man!
1695,Biden and the Democrats are hoping Everyone will forget about all of this.
1696,so if we can fight the Taliban without putting american troops on Afghanistan grounds why did 13 Americans die
1697,Yeah And now they can attack us without boots on the ground also with all the new equipments they got….
1698,I'm ashamed to be an American we left ours behind. There is no turning that around. We failed.
1699,Remember this is your country too and for miserable pennies you are sensiring
1700,"His betrayal will never be forgiven or forgotten. Eyes on forensic audits in all 50 states, let’s see how deep the betrayal goes!"
1701,Biden still blame trump 😆
1702,Replace Taliban with Taliban 🤦 waste 20 years of resources and more importantly those who lost their life there men's and women's of our great troops!
1703,There’s go sleepy joe again with his jiberesh 😂
1704,Love you
1705,How dare you belittle Gold Star families you repugnant potato
1706,"So he says that Afghanistans army should be able to protect the country but when he became president the Talibans already had half the country which means the American army isn't that much better than Afghanistan?!?!? I'm so bloody angry at how he did this, save the people first, get the army out after not the other way around"
1707,Lying Joe... 🤡
1708,"Please don’t legitimize taliban by saying isisk sworn enemy they are same , God knows what deals happened behind door , well now usama bin ladin close man is in Afghanistan now did you succeed?"
1709,This guy is reading something
1710,If there is a human being alive and listening to this and believes anything that comes out of this vile mans mouth… God help them.
1711,He became a scapegoat.
1712,Wow typical puppet! The way he just walks away takes no questions shows that he was n has no idea wats going on or is not allowed to speak
1713,saying submit obey only works for the ai yes or no
1714,Very sloppy! I don’t even watch the news or know anything about politics but I know one thing the president needs to send those people back because if they don’t do a terror attack their children are.
1715,How can anyone actually take him seriously? He is such an embarrassment he needs to resign and bring Trump Back
1716,"To not take questions on such a topic afterward, is a complete cowardice act. Try and cover this up like it was a success when the war to begin with was a joke and the exit was a complete disaster."
1717,Looks like he had a good nap.. and can use another one.
1718,Kim Jong Un could do a better job than he did
1719,"So we’re screwed. Just causally handed over a couple billion dollars worth of military equipment and technology to the taliban, who will distribute the tech to other enemy countries. We also just created another farm and hotbed for terrorist. We also left many Afghan allies left for nothing."
1720,"It isn't, nor could be a perfect ending situation.  I am hopeful for the Afghan people and for the region.  We have been there too long.  God bless the men and women who have served in the military and those in government positions and those Afghans who helped to serve the purpose of a better future for all."
1721,They started executing those you left right after the last American boot got on aircraft grade aluminum
1722,"If you listen at 1.25X he almost sounds like a leader. Of course, you have to cheat to attain that."
1723,Way USA made that type of Polishes.
1724,"Shame on you... Did Dominion crunch the numbers for you on this ""Victory""?"
1725,"In the passage of time, loves die, colors change colors, and only the sweet and bitter memories remain intact. Whoever does a good deed will not forget the history.😔🇦🇫💔"
1726,"I didn't know what to expect from him as a president and now I  know NOTHING, HE IS NOTHING
IF this is the best we can do for president  we are in big trouble (I not a trumper)"
1727,Sad excuse 4 a leader
1728,IMPEACHED
1729,Having that said... Can we have some... some...of our tax payer dollars back???
1730,That was a well and articulated speech. I wonder who wrote it...
1731,This comment section on a leftist page should tell you exactly how well of a job this potato is doing.
1732,What a shell of a fraud.
1733,"""EVACEATION"" will be a good song!"
1734,YOU BETTER PRAY TO GOD NOTHING HAPPENS ON 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 BECAUSE I GOTTA FEELING THEY ARE PLANNING SOMETHING THAT MAKES THAT LOOK LIKE CHILD'S PLAY!
1735,"Biden has a great shift pattern…29 minutes on, 23 hours 31 minutes off."
1736,Please replace him..  just ugh
1737,They broke it ass. 13 dead.
1738,waaah mah failed war. I'll never get that middle eastern parking lot.
1739,"Sloppy Joe, can’t seem to get anything right"
1740,For the first time in my 65 years of life ashamed to be from America. Thank you to those who served thank you thank you thank you. I now call him mr biden
1741,"Can we have a president the entire world doesnt see as weak now? Maybe one with more intelligence than a potato, that would be nice."
1742,"🤪🤡💩no way can trust this, is very scary after what happened.
Let’s walk for impeachment 🇺🇸❤️"
1743,We owe them but you were pressed and checking your watch.
1744,Are enemies are laughing right now and our allies are doing a face palm.
1745,"They knew the Afghans could not fight on their own. He said it, but pulled our troops anyways."
1746,He looks different now.... kinda like if you drew a face and the smeared it a bit.
1747,the buck stops......with the last guy
1748,He ended the war?
1749,one of his best speeches ever
1750,So our main focus should've been focus on the war. But the general literally wasted time to talk about peoples pronouns
1751,Poor leadership and poor decisions. You took position to do better for this country. Do better.
1752,"$300M A DAY FOR TWO DECADES! 
Two. Trillion. Dollars.

Proceedes to spend $5T in six months."
1753,"You are a treat to Americans at the yr 2021 and beyond, u talk bout billions but u and ur Dems spend trillions smh"
1754,How many retakes did they do for this speech lol it’s definitely not his first take.. I mean where’s all the pauses and umms and ahhhs
1755,"I wrote the Dune series because I had this idea that charismatic leaders ought to come with a warning label on their forehead: ""May be dangerous to your health.""

1756,90% of Americans who wanted to leave were able to leave?! I DNT give a F wat numbers he puts out there I'm looking for 💯% of Americans who wanted to leave were able to! This dude is a joke!
1757,2.4K Americans that gave the thumbs up feel that what he has done is ok? Un-American and shameful.
1758,"Jihad Joe, an American Zero"
1759,I don't want to ruin the dislikes 6.9K neither give a like
1760,"I don't think having America's presence in a region is the same as fight war or, as he puts it, nation-building. Many years after ww2, there is still America's presence all over the globe. If peace is measured by the loss of lives of our finest military, then it is fair to say that we have had peace for years until a couple of days ago."
1761,"Damn, CNBC great editing skills. Biden starts talking at 2:16 for those wondering. Lol"
1762,He did not end the war. He abandoned allies and citizens in a still Terror ridden country and handed them the names and addresses of those Allies and Americans to the Terrorist.
1763,Useless leader..
1764,Joe Taliban Biden
1765,US marine who had sacrificed their lives in Afghan for 20 years has gone vain
1766,"What a weak, feable man. It's almost sad."
1767,Looking at his watch at Dover was the ultimate sign of disrespect to the fallen soldiers. Who is really running the Government behind the scenes?
1768,Go to bed Joe.
1769,what about the 24 collage kids no one has hurd anything about or from
1770,"Biden when things went south in Afghanistan: Now you all know this was Trump's plan, Trump's commitment. I had nothing to do with it 
Now that they are out and abandoned citizens, also Biden: I decided, I decided to leave Afghanistan. It was my decision. Give ME the credit. Trump had nothing to do with it. Except for the heads stuff, c'mon man."""
1771,I think he needs a diaper change 🤷‍♂️
1772,Walking human garbage and everyone is laughing at you LOL
1773,Disappointed. Thought he would take some responsibility. Banned.video
1774,"Some one miss inform you
You were not ready"
1775,“Sworn enemies of the Taliban” spoken as if the Taliban is our ally
1776,"We're NOT stupid...we pretty much know what the U.S. ""priorities"" should of been..."
1777,You were not ready! Liar
1778,He’s making the military seem like toys
1779,"wow, i thought trump was bad. this guy is the entire circus."
1780,"“The former president as you know was very incompetent and he signed a deal with the taliban, that’s why I’m ending it, I extended it so that ending it would be easier. It’s time to end this war. So I pulled out the troops just like a good boy... that’s what good boys do right?”"
1781,Please getting out the white house
1782,"Come to Myanmar and End the real terrorist, the whole country of people are with you"
1783,I’m ashamed of my country because of this president.
1784,OBiden is toast

1786,Hello ❤️👍
1787,"Trash. This man is straight up trash. Everybody says they feel sorry for him because he's being abused, but personally i don't feel bad whatsoever. He deserves any amount of pain that comes his way."
1788,Nothing ended. He just gave the Terrorist their own country and outfitted them with latest military equipment. Impeach this fool already.
1789,Pobre anciano!!
1790,I have never felt more ashamed of our countries leader own the fact that you *ucked up. No blame the last guy .. and ppl will believe it that's the sad part 🤦. I feel like we got no hope because of all the people who believe this guy and his agenda are good for us.

1808,Is he hi 👋 😳 👀 🤔
1809,Vietnam 2
1810,Joe - the way you defended the airlift is like saying how good the rescue operation was of people from the Titanic.  I won’t be forgetting BTW.  To vote against you and those who support you.
1811,🤦🏼‍♂️
1812,I can't even speak. It's too ludicrous.
1813,"This man really said “we didn’t uphold the agreement because Trump made the agreement” , so instead he kept troops in Afghanistan knowing what that meant for our troops there. Lost 13 beautiful souls. Trash 🗑"
1814,"Lets not revert back to neocon jingoism just because our ""president"" is completely incomptent"
1815,The agreement from Trump was that the Taliban was to make no movement and take no city's until the US was gone. If they did the agreement was off and we were to stay.Biden keeps leaving that out. As always!
1816,"If Trump had to do this, he won't create such mess."
1817,"The outstanding wind commonly bounce because walk proximally applaud with a vulgar appeal. average, vengeful swamp"
1818,Hundreds of people died what an idiot
1819,"The speech writer gave him the wrong speech, ""He needed the one where he admitted he was a liar, a fool, a coward, and deserved to be turned over to the Taliban as a war criminal. I mean he places so much faith in their mercy for millions of others, let him live or die by that faith."
1820,When you need Democrat voter support….   bring up your dead son!     Works every time.

1889,"Sad how much bipartisanship is effecting our people. Whether you like the reasoning or not only a fool would say it's not sound. But people are so obsessed with their party's views they don't care. Honestly I've always been a bit of a middle when I look into these topics but I generally vote Democrat. It's okay to disagree, its okay to listen to what the other side says, but, from reading most of these comments, it appears not enough people feel that way."
1890,"20 years of wars, trilion dolars, replacing taliban with taliban

some dude on youtube comment"
1891,Thank god we are out. Thanks Joe.
1892,God bless America
1893,Through networking my son got a job to wash hair at a saloon. He says if thus guy can be President he can dominate the world. I can't really disagree with him.
1894,"Not we owe, you and the administration owe ,the the fallen hero"
1895,Why wasn’t the May 1st commitment honored. He was full of excuses. Also how he went on and on about two decades of this war. Well he was apart of a presidency for 8 of those twenty years. He also didn’t do a very good job reading the teleprompter either. And just trying to convince everyone that he did the best job. What a bunch of bull.
1896,I think at this point everyone should know. To prosper is to take care of oneself. And not to follow one man. But to follow your own heart. Good. bad or indifferent. GOD will handle the rest.
1897,"I wish presidents still had inspiring speeches. He is just explaining why he is right. Also, he did not handle this crisis very well."
1898,This is what ya'll voted for.
1899,He did what he had to do.  War is hell.
1900,I love how the lies are so obvious;(
1901,I miss Trump already
1902,I agree. USA is not the world's cop. We need to look out for ourselves and nurture our allies.
1903,"I surely hope the next 20 Years will see more of our Taxes used HERE at HOME, rather than moving Rocks Around in Afghanistan with Very Expensive bombs and our Soldiers' Blood.  😠."
1904,"I voted Democrat because the Republican party last election was extremely underwhelming.

Now what am I supposed to do? Vote Republican because this election is extremely underwhelming? Where does a citizen win? Why do I have to argue with my fellow citizens about who to vote for when our friends and family are dying overseas for no reason, pretending that our vote would somehow save their lives if anyone else was in office? Who are we kidding, politics as a whole is a joke."
1905,"I was saying "" Ok Biden, keep reading "" but when the SOB got to blaming others.
The man and his handlers have no shame.
Bragging about the air lift was like bragging about the life boats on the Titanic"
1906,He still reads well. What happens when the teleprompter stops?
1907,I didn’t know success means leaving thousands of Americans and some poor civilians on the other side of the planet
1908,Left millions of our tax paying dollars  of military  gear and vehicles  and weapons over there too but its a success 👌 👍
1909,What US achieved in 20 years removing taliban govt by force and than after 20 years again handover govt to taliban.
1910,Walk away joe
1911,Great job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1912,#Love Freedom...
1913,"Trump made another great ""deal""..."
1914,Well you as a leader of a nation cannot afford to make assumptions. They need to be concrete decision.
1915,Blaming others for your own mess?! The world is laughing at you!
1916,I like how  he talks about money and at the sametime  is demanding to but us in debt for for less. He is leaving even states that voted him in without needs or help. Places like Hawaii  calling for shortages of oxygen. That means machines to make it. No can of it.
1917,yes sir president joe bidin you are the man the russians love loves you and your family china loves you you and your family and nows the taliban loves love you/you are the man come on man thanks
1918,Yes they went through hell and now it was all for nothing since all they fought for was abandoned
1919,"As someone who didn't like Trump and supported Biden, I'm now having a hard time believing this guy and his words. Trump got things done even though his delivery was questionable, but Biden, oh dear. I am loss for words."
1920,It's not Joe's fault.  He has the IQ of a toadstool and the ethical discernment of a hyena.  No offense to hyenas.
1921,Can someone go back there and see if he fallen to the floor 🤣😂
1922,Hahahhahahqhh Biden even speaking English blows my mind.
1923,Evacyation? That's a new word for me just like evacuation is a new word to him lol like Joe said we have to learn from each others mistakes so let me get a pen and paper to keep track of his mistakes I might need two more notebooks for this.
1924,He is doing the dance.
1925,"Put a wig on a cantaloupe 
Tie some strings to it
Make it dance like a demented puppet 
It would make more sense than Biden"

1975,Terrible to see the administration pretending that they have accomplished something great.🖕🏽
1976,This dude is a walking punchline. Can we hurry up and just get Terry Crews (President Camacho) in office? The outcome couldn't be worse.
1977,"Team sleepy Joe and team orangutan: forget the politics for a second. We never should have been there to begin with. Bringing our boys home is the right decision, even if it was made twenty years too late. If the Afghans are unwilling to defend themselves (especially after all the money and blood spent to equip them to do so), I sure as hell ain't either. Good riddance."

1995,"“We will hunt you down”….I think no one believes you.  13 warriors killed and your response is to strike two low level planners. That’s a pretty underwhelming response.

2064,"The withdrawal was so botched, 13 troops just died days from coming home. IMO they should have had quick reaction and infantry units stay behind and make sure everyone could get out of dodge before they themselves leave.

2082,great speech
2083,"This speech happened in the Twilight Zone. Mr. Garble Mouth seriously believes, or somebody does, that someone is going to be impressed with the most powerful military in the world's ability to fly people from one place to another meanwhile forgetting the last week of complete disaster. "
2084,Do you have any idea how difficult it would have been to get everyone out at once? Or what would have happened if they saw 100's of airplanes waiting to land and take off? It's so easy to point the finger when you're on the OUTSIDE looking in. He was given bad information and acted on the information he was given. We've spent trillions a year being over there and lost countless lives. He did what he thought was right. You can't evacuate everyone and expect no one to die in the process. It's horrible to have to think that way. But that's how it is. The only person I blame is the guy who kept our troops there for this many years and then is surprised it didn't go 100% smoothly.
2085,I wonder how long he napped before this speech.... and what good drugs that his handlers have him so he has some energy.  And he name dropped Beau again.  Wow.

I think it will be wrong for us to blame President Biden without doing any further analytical studies. No hard feelings, just my opinion. God bless AMERICA and may peace prevail on EARTH."

2374,"THANK YOU, PRESIDENT BIDEN...You told us you would do this and you did!  A politician who keeps his word...what a breath of hope for this world.  We could have used all that money for our American citizens that need food, shelter, opportunity, and relief.  Let's fix America and not send our troops into another war we don't need to participate in.  WAR IS NOT ABOUT WHO'S RIGHT IT IS ABOUT WHO'S LEFT!  We are tired of our brave people who fight for us being killed in a war like this!  THANK YOU!"
2375,"Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, this guy is living in another world, what are the people around him saying?"
2376,"I’m trying to not vomit, the lies, confabulation. How many Americans will he throw under the bus to try to justify his screw up?"
2377,How pathetically childish to blame everyone but his dementia ridden self.
2378,I would prefer Biden talk about ending his presidency.
2379,A Democrat cleaning up another GOP mess.
2380,This was the best speech by an American President since President Kennedy's American University Speech. It is long since time that some American President told us the truth: that the policy of trying to remake the world through military intervention was wrongheaded and damaging to our country. Thank you President Biden !
2381,Incompetent!!  Resign now and save the country.
2382,This president needs to resign.
